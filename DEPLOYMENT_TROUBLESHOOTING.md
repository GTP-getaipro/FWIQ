# 🔍 Deployment Not Updating - Troubleshooting Guide

## 🚨 Issue: Deployed but App Still Shows Old Version

This usually means one of three things:
1. **Browser cache** is showing old files
2. **Coolify** didn't pull latest code
3. **Deployment failed** silently

---

## ✅ **Quick Fix Checklist (Try These First)**

### **1. Hard Refresh Your Browser** (90% of the time this is it!)

**Windows/Linux:**
- Chrome/Edge: `Ctrl + Shift + R` or `Ctrl + F5`
- Firefox: `Ctrl + Shift + Delete` (clear cache)

**Mac:**
- Chrome/Safari: `Cmd + Shift + R`
- Firefox: `Cmd + Shift + Delete`

**Or manually:**
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Right-click the refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

### **2. Clear Browser Cache Completely**

**Chrome/Edge:**
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
2. Select "All time"
3. Check "Cached images and files"
4. Click "Clear data"

### **3. Try Incognito/Private Mode**

Open your app in an incognito window:
- Chrome: `Ctrl + Shift + N`
- Firefox: `Ctrl + Shift + P`

Go to: `https://app.floworx-iq.com`

If it works in incognito → It's a cache issue!

## 🔧 **Verify Deployment Status**

### **Step 1: Check Coolify Deployment Logs**

1. Go to Coolify dashboard
2. Find your FloWorx app
3. Click "Deployments" tab
4. Check the latest deployment:
   - ✅ Should say "Deployed successfully"
   - ❌ If it says "Failed" → deployment didn't work

### **Step 2: Check What's Actually Running**

Look for these in the logs:
```
✅ Building...
✅ npm install completed
✅ npm run build completed
✅ Container started
✅ Health check passed
```

### **Step 3: Check Build Time**

The deployment timestamp should be **recent** (within last 10 minutes).

## 📦 **Verify Git Push**

### **Check if your code was actually pushed to GitHub:**

<function_calls>
<invoke name="run_terminal_cmd">
<parameter name="command">cd c:\FloWorx-Production && git log --oneline -5
