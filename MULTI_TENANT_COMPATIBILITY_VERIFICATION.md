# Multi-Tenant Compatibility - Feature Verification

## 🎯 Question: Do These Features Work for ALL Businesses?

**Answer: YES! ✅ All features are 100% business-agnostic**

## ✅ Feature-by-Feature Verification

### **Feature 1: Custom Form Links** ✅ UNIVERSAL

## 🔍 What's Business-Specific vs Universal

### **Universal (Just Implemented):**
- ✅ Role types (Sales, Service, Operations, Support, Owner)
- ✅ Email forwarding logic
- ✅ AI draft formatting
- ✅ Operating hours, service areas, holidays
- ✅ Custom form links
- ✅ Social media injection

### **Business-Specific (Already Exists):**
- 📁 Folder structure (Hot Tub has "WaterCare", HVAC has "FilterReplacement")
- 🏷️ Classifier categories (Hot Tub: SpaRepair vs HVAC: TuneUp)
- 📝 AI prompts (industry terminology)

**But the ROUTING logic is universal!**

---

## 🎯 How Multi-Tenancy Works

### **Each Business Gets:**

**1. Generic Infrastructure (NEW!):**
- ✅ Role-based routing engine
- ✅ Email forwarding system
- ✅ Business context injection
- ✅ Custom form integration

**2. Business-Specific Content:**
- 📁 Their unique folder structure
- 🏷️ Their industry categories
- 📝 Their custom AI prompts
- 👥 Their team members

**Example:**

**Hot Tub Man:**
```
Generic: Sales Manager role → Routes SALES emails
Specific: SALES has subcategories (NewSpaSales, AccessorySales)
Forward: mark@hottubman.ca gets SALES emails + AI draft
```

**HVAC Pro:**
```
Generic: Sales Manager role → Routes SALES emails
Specific: SALES has subcategories (NewSystemQuotes, DuctlessQuotes)
Forward: john@hvacpro.com gets SALES emails + AI draft
```

**Same routing logic, different content!** ✅

## 🔧 How It Adapts to Different Industries

### **Role Mapping Example:**

Service Manager → Handles heater repairs, water chemistry
Operations Manager → Handles chemical supplier relationships
```

**HVAC Business:**
```
Sales Manager → Handles system quotes, new installations

Operations Manager → Handles equipment supplier relationships
```

```

**Same 5 roles, different context!** ✅

---

## 🧠 AI Adaptation

### **Generic AI System Message:**

**What's Universal:**
```
### Team Structure & Email Routing:

**Mark Johnson** - mark@example.com
Roles: Sales Manager + Operations Manager
→ Handles: New inquiries, Quotes, Pricing, Vendors, Suppliers
→ Routes when:
  • Email mentions "Mark"
  • Email classified as: SALES or MANAGER
  • Email contains keywords: quote, price, vendor, supplier
→ Forwarding: ✅ Emails forwarded to mark@example.com WITH AI draft
```

**What's Business-Specific:**
```
### Business Context:
- Business Name: {{BUSINESS_NAME}}  ← Varies
- Business Type: {{BUSINESS_TYPE}}  ← Varies
- Primary Products: {{PRIMARY_PRODUCT}} ← Varies

### Category Structure:
SALES:
- Hot Tub: NewSpaSales, AccessorySales  ← Business-specific
- HVAC: NewSystemQuotes, MaintenancePlans ← Business-specific
```

**Routing logic stays the same!** ✅

---

## 📋 Industry-Specific Customization (If Needed)

### **Current Roles (Generic):**
```
1. Sales Manager
2. Service Manager
3. Operations Manager
4. Support Lead
5. Owner/CEO
```

### **Optional: Industry-Specific Role Labels**

**Could customize labels per industry:**

**HVAC:**
```
1. Sales Manager → "System Sales Specialist"
2. Service Manager → "HVAC Technician Lead"
3. Operations Manager → "Dispatcher"
4. Support Lead → "Customer Service Rep"
```

**Plumbing:**
```
1. Sales Manager → "Project Manager"
2. Service Manager → "Master Plumber"
3. Operations Manager → "Office Manager"
4. Support Lead → "Service Coordinator"
```

**But underlying role IDs stay the same!**

**Implementation:**
```javascript
const getRoleLabel = (roleId, businessType) => {
  const labels = {
    'sales_manager': {
      'HVAC': 'System Sales Specialist',
      'Plumber': 'Project Manager',
      'default': 'Sales Manager'
    },
    'service_manager': {
      'HVAC': 'HVAC Technician Lead',
      'Plumber': 'Master Plumber',
      'default': 'Service Manager'
    }
  };
  
  return labels[roleId]?.[businessType] || labels[roleId]?.default || roleId;
};
```

**Optional enhancement - not required!**

---

## ✅ Verification Checklist

### **Code Review:**

**Generic Components:**
- ✅ `AVAILABLE_ROLES` - No business-specific roles
- ✅ `getRoleConfiguration()` - Generic keywords (price, repair, vendor)
- ✅ `buildTeamRoutingRules()` - No hardcoded business logic
- ✅ `buildCallToActionFromForms()` - Generic form mapping
- ✅ Business context formatters - Just data formatting
- ✅ Forwarding nodes - Provider-agnostic

**No Hot Tub specific code in routing logic!** ✅

---

### **Template Verification:**

**goldStandardReplyPrompt.js:**
```javascript
// Uses placeholders:
{{BUSINESS_NAME}}
{{BUSINESS_TYPE}}
{{PRIMARY_PRODUCT_SERVICE}}
<<<TEAM_ROUTING_RULES>>>
<<<CALL_TO_ACTION_OPTIONS>>>
```

**✅ Completely generic!**

**hotTubManAIDraftAgentSystemMessage.js:**
```javascript
// Only used for Hot Tub Man specific deployment
// Not used by other businesses
```

**✅ Isolated, doesn't affect other businesses**
