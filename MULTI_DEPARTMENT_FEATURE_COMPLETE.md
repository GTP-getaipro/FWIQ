## 📊 Category Combinations

### **Common Combinations:**

| Departments Selected | Categories Allowed | Use Case |
|---------------------|-------------------|----------|
| `['all']` | ALL | Office Hub (small business) |
| `['sales']` | SALES, FORMSUB | Sales team only |
| `['support']` | SUPPORT, URGENT | Support team only |
| `['sales', 'support']` | SALES, FORMSUB, SUPPORT, URGENT | Customer service team |
| `['support', 'urgent']` | SUPPORT, URGENT | On-call / after-hours |
| `['operations']` | MANAGER, SUPPLIERS, BANKING, RECRUITMENT | Back office |
| `['sales', 'support', 'operations']` | Most categories (excludes MISC) | Multi-role manager |

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Database:**

```sql
-- department_scope is now JSONB array
department_scope JSONB DEFAULT '["all"]'

-- Examples:
'["all"]'                           -- Office Hub
'["sales"]'                         -- Sales only
'["sales", "support"]'              -- Sales + Support
'["support", "urgent"]'             -- Support + Urgent
'["sales", "support", "operations"]' -- Three departments
```

---

### **AI System Message (Sales + Support):**

```
🎯 DEPARTMENT SCOPE RESTRICTION - CRITICAL

THIS WORKFLOW HANDLES: Sales + Support
Departments: Sales - New inquiries, quotes | Support - Customer service, emergencies

ALLOWED CATEGORIES FOR CLASSIFICATION:
  ✅ SALES
  ✅ FORMSUB
  ✅ SUPPORT
  ✅ URGENT

FOR ANY EMAIL THAT DOES NOT FIT:
Return OUT_OF_SCOPE

EXAMPLES:
✅ "I want a quote" → SALES (allowed)
✅ "My heater is broken" → SUPPORT (allowed)
⚠️ "Invoice from supplier" → OUT_OF_SCOPE (operations not in scope)
```

---

### **UI Logic:**

```javascript
// Toggle department selection
const toggleDepartment = (dept) => {
  if (dept === 'all') {
    // "All" selected → clear others, set to ['all']
    newScope = ['all'];
  } else {
    // Specific dept selected → remove 'all', toggle dept
    filteredScope = departmentScope.filter(d => d !== 'all');
    
    if (filteredScope.includes(dept)) {
      // Already selected → remove it
      newScope = filteredScope.filter(d => d !== dept);
      
      // If nothing left → default to 'all'
      if (newScope.length === 0) newScope = ['all'];
    } else {
      // Not selected → add it
      newScope = [...filteredScope, dept];
    }
  }
};

// Examples:
['all'] + click 'sales' → ['sales']
['sales'] + click 'support' → ['sales', 'support']
['sales', 'support'] + click 'sales' → ['support']
['support'] + click 'support' → ['all'] (default when empty)
```

## 🔍 AI Classification Examples

### **Combination: Sales + Support**

**Email 1: "I want a quote for a hot tub"**
```javascript
// AI receives allowed categories: [SALES, FORMSUB, SUPPORT, URGENT]
{
  "primary_category": "SALES",  // ✅ Allowed
  "secondary_category": "NewInquiry",
  "confidence": 0.92,
  "ai_can_reply": true
}
```

**Email 2: "My jets aren't working"**
```javascript
{
  "primary_category": "SUPPORT",  // ✅ Allowed
  "secondary_category": "Technical",
  "confidence": 0.89,
  "ai_can_reply": true
}
```

**Email 3: "Invoice from AquaSpa Pool Supply"**
```javascript
{
  "primary_category": "OUT_OF_SCOPE",  // ⚠️ Not allowed (SUPPLIERS)
  "summary": "Email does not belong to selected departments",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "ai_can_reply": false
}
```

## 📋 Implementation Details

### **Database Schema:**

```sql
-- JSONB array for flexibility
department_scope JSONB DEFAULT '["all"]'

-- Valid examples:
'["all"]'                      -- Office Hub
'["sales"]'                    -- Sales only
'["sales", "support"]'         -- Sales + Support
'["support", "urgent"]'        -- Support + Urgent
'["sales", "support", "operations"]'  -- Three departments
```

---

### **Category Resolution Logic:**

```javascript
// Backend combines categories from selected departments
departments = ['sales', 'support'];

salesCategories = ['SALES', 'FORMSUB'];
supportCategories = ['SUPPORT', 'URGENT'];

// Combine and deduplicate
allowedCategories = [
  ...salesCategories, 
  ...supportCategories
];
// Result: ['SALES', 'FORMSUB', 'SUPPORT', 'URGENT']

// If URGENT appears in both support and urgent:
departments = ['support', 'urgent'];
supportCategories = ['SUPPORT', 'URGENT'];
urgentCategories = ['URGENT'];

combined = ['SUPPORT', 'URGENT', 'URGENT'];
uniqueCategories = [...new Set(combined)];
// Result: ['SUPPORT', 'URGENT']
```

---
