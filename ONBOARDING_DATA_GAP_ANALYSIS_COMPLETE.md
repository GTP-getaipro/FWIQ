##  🔴 **Critical Missing Data (High Priority)**

### 1. **Operating Hours / Business Hours** ⏰

**What's Collected:**
```javascript
businessHours: {
  monday: { open: '09:00', close: '17:00', closed: false },
  tuesday: { open: '10:00', close: '17:00', closed: false },
  wednesday: { open: '09:00', close: '17:00', closed: false },
  thursday: { open: '09:00', close: '17:00', closed: false },
  friday: { open: '09:00', close: '17:00', closed: false },
  saturday: { open: '10:00', close: '16:00', closed: false },
  sunday: { open: '', close: '', closed: true }
}
```

**Current Injection:** 
```javascript
{{OPERATING_HOURS}} // Exists as placeholder but not properly populated!
```

**What AI Should Know:**
```markdown
## Business Hours:
- Monday-Friday: 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM
- Saturday: 10:00 AM - 4:00 PM  
- Sunday: Closed

When replying outside business hours, mention:
"We're currently closed but will respond when we open at 9:00 AM Monday."
```

**Why This Matters:**
- AI can tell customers when to expect a human response
- AI can apologize for after-hours delays
- AI can suggest calling during business hours for urgent issues
- Builds trust with accurate availability information

**Example Without:**
```
Customer: "Can I get a quote today?"
AI: "I'll have someone get back to you soon."  ❌ Vague
```

**Example With:**
```
Customer: "Can I get a quote today?" (sent at 6 PM)
AI: "We're currently closed for the day (hours: 9 AM - 5 PM).  ✅ Specific
     I'll have Mark get back to you first thing tomorrow morning 
     with a quote. If it's urgent, you can call our after-hours line
     at (403) 555-0123."
```

---

### 2. **Service Areas** 📍

**What's Collected:**
```javascript
serviceArea: "Red Deer, Sylvan Lake, Lacombe, Leduc"
// or
serviceAreas: ['Red Deer', 'Sylvan Lake', 'Lacombe', 'Leduc']
```

**Current Injection:**
```javascript
{{SERVICE_AREAS}} // Exists but not always populated correctly
```

**What AI Should Know:**
```markdown
## Service Areas:
We serve: Red Deer, Sylvan Lake, Lacombe, and Leduc

For locations outside our service area, mention:
"We typically serve [areas], but let me check if we can accommodate your location."
```

**Why This Matters:**
- AI can proactively mention service area coverage
- AI can quote travel fees for out-of-area requests
- AI can decline politely if location is too far
- Prevents wasted time on unserviceable areas

**Example Without:**
```
Customer: "Do you service Grande Prairie?"
AI: "Yes! We can schedule a visit."  ❌ Wrong answer
```

**Example With:**
```
Customer: "Do you service Grande Prairie?"
AI: "We typically serve Red Deer, Sylvan Lake, Lacombe, and Leduc.  ✅ Accurate
     Grande Prairie is outside our regular service area, but let me 
     check with our team if we can accommodate a special trip. 
     There may be additional travel fees."
```

---

### 3. **After-Hours Phone / Emergency Contact** 📞

**What's Collected:**
```javascript
afterHoursPhone: "(403) 555-0123"
```

**Current Injection:**
```javascript
// ❌ NOT INJECTED AT ALL!
```

**What AI Should Know:**
```markdown
## Emergency Contact:
For urgent issues after hours, call: (403) 555-0123

When customer has URGENT issue and it's outside business hours:
"For immediate assistance, please call our after-hours line at (403) 555-0123."
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Critical for URGENT category emails (leaks, no heat, emergencies)
- Provides immediate resolution path for emergencies
- Reduces customer frustration
- Prevents negative reviews from unaddressed emergencies

**Example Without:**
```
Customer: "Water is leaking from my hot tub!" (sent at 10 PM)
AI: "Thanks for reaching out. We'll get back to you soon."  ❌ Dangerous!
```

**Example With:**
```
Customer: "Water is leaking from my hot tub!" (sent at 10 PM)
AI: "This sounds urgent! Since it's after hours, please call our  ✅ Helpful
     emergency line immediately at (403) 555-0123 for assistance.
     In the meantime, turn off your tub at the breaker to prevent
     further damage."
```

## 🟡 **Recommended Missing Data (Medium Priority)**

### 4. **Holiday Exceptions** 🎄

**What's Collected:**
```javascript
holidayExceptions: [
  { date: '2025-12-25', reason: 'Christmas Day' },
  { date: '2025-01-01', reason: "New Year's Day" },
  { date: '2025-07-01', reason: 'Canada Day' }
]
```

**Current Injection:**
```javascript
// ❌ NOT INJECTED!
```

**What AI Should Know:**
```markdown
## Upcoming Holidays (Closed):
- December 25, 2025: Christmas Day
- January 1, 2026: New Year's Day
- July 1, 2026: Canada Day

When customer requests service on/near a holiday:
"We'll be closed on [date] for [holiday]. The next available date would be [date]."
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Prevents scheduling conflicts
- Sets accurate expectations
- Reduces customer frustration from delayed responses
- Shows professionalism

**Example:**
```
Customer: "Can you come out December 26th?"
AI: "We'll be closed December 25-26 for Christmas. Our first  ✅
     available date is December 27th. Would that work?"
```

### 5. **Social Media Links** 📱

**What's Collected:**
```javascript
socialLinks: [
  'https://www.facebook.com/hottubman',
  'https://www.instagram.com/hottubman'
]
```

**Current Injection:**
```javascript

// ❌ NOT INJECTED!
```

**What AI Should Know:**
```markdown
## Contact Options:
- General inquiries: info@hottubman.ca

## 🔧 Implementation Code Snippets

### 1. **Operating Hours Injection**

**Add to `supabase/functions/deploy-n8n/index.ts`:**

```typescript
// Format business hours for AI
const businessHours = rules?.businessHours || {};
const operatingHoursText = formatBusinessHoursForAI(businessHours);

function formatBusinessHoursForAI(hours) {
  const days = ['monday', 'tuesday', 'wednesday', 'thursday', 'friday', 'saturday', 'sunday'];
  const formatted = [];
  
  days.forEach(day => {
    const dayData = hours[day];
    if (dayData && !dayData.closed) {
      const dayName = day.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + day.slice(1);
      formatted.push(`${dayName}: ${dayData.open} - ${dayData.close}`);
    } else if (dayData && dayData.closed) {
      formatted.push(`${day.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + day.slice(1)}: Closed`);
    }
  });
  
  return formatted.join('\n');
}

// Add to replacements:
'<<<OPERATING_HOURS>>>': operatingHoursText,
```

**Add to AI System Message:**
```markdown
## Business Operating Hours:
<<<OPERATING_HOURS>>>

When replying outside business hours, acknowledge the delay:
"We're currently closed. Our next business day starts at [time]."
```

---

### 2. **After-Hours Phone Injection**

**Add to replacements:**
```typescript
'<<<AFTER_HOURS_PHONE>>>': contact?.phone || contact?.afterHoursPhone || '',
```

**Add to AI System Message:**
```markdown
## Emergency Contact:
For URGENT issues (leaks, emergencies, critical failures):
Direct customers to call: <<<AFTER_HOURS_PHONE>>>

Example: "This sounds urgent! Please call our after-hours line at <<<AFTER_HOURS_PHONE>>> for immediate assistance."
```

---

### 3. **Service Areas Injection**

**Add to replacements:**
```typescript
const serviceAreasText = Array.isArray(business.serviceAreas) 
  ? business.serviceAreas.join(', ')
  : business.serviceArea || 'Not specified';

'<<<SERVICE_AREAS>>>': serviceAreasText,
```

**Add to AI System Message:**
```markdown
## Service Areas:
We serve: <<<SERVICE_AREAS>>>

For location-specific inquiries:
- If customer is in service area: Confirm availability
- If customer is outside: "We typically serve [areas], but let me check if we can accommodate your location. There may be additional travel fees."
```

---

### 4. **Holiday Exceptions Injection**

**Add to replacements:**
```typescript
const holidays = rules?.holidays || holidayExceptions || [];
const upcomingHolidays = holidays
  .filter(h => new Date(h.date) > new Date())
  .sort((a, b) => new Date(a.date) - new Date(b.date))
  .slice(0, 5);

const holidaysText = upcomingHolidays
  .map(h => `${h.date}: ${h.reason}`)
  .join('\n');

'<<<UPCOMING_HOLIDAYS>>>': holidaysText || 'No upcoming holidays scheduled',
```

**Add to AI System Message:**
```markdown
## Upcoming Holidays (Closed):
<<<UPCOMING_HOLIDAYS>>>

When scheduling near a holiday:
"We'll be closed on [date] for [reason]. Our next available date is [date after holiday]."
```

---

### 5. **Social Media Links Injection**

**Add to replacements:**
```typescript
const socialLinks = contact?.socialLinks || [];
const socialText = socialLinks.length > 0
  ? socialLinks.map((link, i) => `Link ${i+1}: ${link}`).join('\n')
  : 'No social media links provided';

'<<<SOCIAL_MEDIA_LINKS>>>': socialText,
```

**Add to Signature Block:**
```markdown
Follow us for tips and updates:
<<<SOCIAL_MEDIA_LINKS>>>
```
