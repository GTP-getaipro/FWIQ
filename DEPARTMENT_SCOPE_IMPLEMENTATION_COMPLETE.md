# ✅ Department Scope Feature - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

**Date:** October 30, 2025  
**Feature:** One Profile = One Department = One Flow  
**Status:** ✅ Ready for Testing & Deployment

---

## 🎉 What Was Implemented

### **Core Feature:**
Users can now configure their FloWorx workflow to handle:
- **All Departments (Office Hub)** - Default, processes everything
- **Sales Only** - Only SALES and FORMSUB emails
- **Support Only** - Only SUPPORT and URGENT emails
- **Operations Only** - Only MANAGER, SUPPLIERS, BANKING, RECRUITMENT emails
- **Urgent Only** - Only URGENT emergency emails
- **Custom** - User-defined categories

---

## 📋 Implementation Summary

### **1. Database Changes** ✅

**File:** `supabase/migrations/20251030_add_department_scope.sql`

**Changes:**
```sql
-- Added to business_profiles
- department_scope TEXT DEFAULT 'all'
- department_categories JSONB (for custom departments)

-- Added to workflows
- department_scope TEXT DEFAULT 'all'

-- Indexes for performance
- idx_business_profiles_department_scope
- idx_workflows_department_scope
```

**Migration Status:** Ready to run

---

### **2. Onboarding UI** ✅

**File:** `src/pages/onboarding/Step2EmailN8n.jsx`

**Added:**
- Department scope selector dropdown
- Real-time save to database
- Department-specific help text
- Visual indicators for each department type

**UI Elements:**
```jsx
<select value={departmentScope} onChange={handleDepartmentChange}>
  <option value="all">🏢 All Departments (Office Hub)</option>
  <option value="sales">💰 Sales Only</option>
  <option value="support">🛠️ Support Only</option>
  <option value="operations">⚙️ Operations Only</option>
  <option value="urgent">🚨 Urgent/Emergency Only</option>
  <option value="custom">⚡ Custom</option>
</select>
```

**Dynamic Help Text:**
- Shows which categories will be processed
- Explains what happens to out-of-scope emails
- Color-coded by department type

---

### **3. AI Classification Filtering** ✅

**File:** `supabase/functions/deploy-n8n/index.ts`

**Added:** Lines 1807-1891

**Logic:**
1. Fetches `department_scope` from business_profiles
2. Defines allowed categories per department:
   - Sales: `['SALES', 'FORMSUB']`
   - Support: `['SUPPORT', 'URGENT']`
   - Operations: `['MANAGER', 'SUPPLIERS', 'BANKING', 'RECRUITMENT']`
   - Urgent: `['URGENT']`
3. Appends department restriction to AI system message
4. AI returns `OUT_OF_SCOPE` for non-department emails

**AI Instructions Added:**
```
🎯 DEPARTMENT SCOPE RESTRICTION - CRITICAL

THIS WORKFLOW HANDLES: Sales Department

ALLOWED CATEGORIES:
  ✅ SALES
  ✅ FORMSUB

FOR ANY EMAIL THAT DOES NOT FIT:
Return "OUT_OF_SCOPE" classification
```

---

### **4. Dashboard Badge** ✅

**File:** `src/components/SimplifiedDashboard.jsx`

**Added:**
- Department scope badge in header
- Fetches department_scope from database
- Color-coded badges:
  - Sales: Green 💰
  - Support: Blue 🛠️
  - Operations: Purple ⚙️
  - Urgent: Red 🚨
  - All: Gradient 📧

**Display:**
```
FloWorx [💰 Sales Department]
or
FloWorx [📧 Office Hub (All Departments)]
```

---

## 📊 How It Works

### **Example: Sales Department User**

**Step 1: Onboarding**
```
1. Connect sales@thehottubman.ca
2. Select "Sales Only" from department dropdown
3. Saves to database: department_scope = 'sales'
4. Continue onboarding as normal
```

**Step 2: Deployment**
```
1. deploy-n8n edge function runs
2. Reads department_scope = 'sales'
3. Injects AI filter into system message
4. AI only classifies into SALES and FORMSUB
5. Workflow deployed with restrictions
```

**Step 3: Runtime (Email Processing)**
```
Email arrives: "I need a quote for a hot tub"
  ↓
AI classifies: { primary_category: "SALES", ... }
  ↓
✅ PROCESSED: Labeled, drafted, routed

Email arrives: "My heater is broken, need repair"
  ↓
AI classifies: { primary_category: "OUT_OF_SCOPE", reason: "Support email" }
  ↓
⚠️ OUT_OF_SCOPE: Labeled only, no draft, no routing
```

## 🎯 Department Category Mappings

```javascript
const departmentMap = {
  all: {
    categories: 'ALL',
    description: 'Office Hub - processes everything',
    filter: false
  },
  sales: {
    categories: ['SALES', 'FORMSUB'],
    description: 'Sales inquiries and form submissions',
    filter: true
  },
  support: {
    categories: ['SUPPORT', 'URGENT'],
    description: 'Customer service and emergencies',
    filter: true
  },
  operations: {
    categories: ['MANAGER', 'SUPPLIERS', 'BANKING', 'RECRUITMENT'],
    description: 'Internal operations and management',
    filter: true
  },
  urgent: {
    categories: ['URGENT'],
    description: 'Emergency requests only',
    filter: true
  },
  custom: {
    categories: user_defined,
    description: 'Custom category list',
    filter: true
  }
};
```

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### **Step 1: Run Database Migration**

```bash
# In Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
# Run: supabase/migrations/20251030_add_department_scope.sql

```
✅ Department scope migration completed successfully
   - Added department_scope to business_profiles
   - Added department_categories for custom configurations
   - Added department_scope to workflows

1. Login to FloWorx
2. Go to Settings (or re-enter onboarding)
3. See department selector
4. Change to "Sales Only"
5. Redeploy workflow
6. Send test emails (sales + support)

   - Support email: Labeled OUT_OF_SCOPE
```

---

### **Step 4: Test with New User**

```
1. Create new account
2. Onboarding Step 2: Connect Email
3. See department selector
4. Choose "Support Only"
5. Complete onboarding
6. Deploy workflow

## 💰 Business Impact

### **Market Expansion:**

**Before:**
- Small businesses only (1-10 employees)
- One email per business

**After:**
- Small businesses: Office Hub mode
- Medium businesses: Each manager has department email
- Large businesses: Multiple department-focused profiles

**Addressable Market:**
```
Small businesses: ~15M (current)
Medium businesses: ~5M (new)
Total: ~20M businesses (+33%)
```

### **Revenue Impact:**

**Pricing Tiers:**
```
Office Hub:     $50/month   (1 profile)
Sales Dept:     $50/month   (1 profile, focused)
Support Dept:   $50/month   (1 profile, focused)
Operations:     $50/month   (1 profile, focused)

Medium Business with 3 departments:
  $50 × 3 = $150/month total
  
vs Office Hub for everyone: $50/month

Additional Revenue: +200% per medium business
```

## 🔧 Known Limitations

### **Current Implementation:**

1. **No inter-department forwarding**
   - OUT_OF_SCOPE emails are just labeled
   - Not automatically forwarded to correct department
   - User must manually review OUT_OF_SCOPE label

2. **No OUT_OF_SCOPE label auto-creation**
   - User must manually create OUT_OF_SCOPE label/folder
   - Or workflow will fail when trying to apply it

3. **No custom category UI**
   - "Custom" option selected but no UI to configure
   - Would need additional development

### **Future Enhancements:**

1. **Auto-create OUT_OF_SCOPE label** during provisioning
2. **Inter-department forwarding** (forward OUT_OF_SCOPE to office@)
3. **Custom category configuration UI**
4. **Department analytics dashboard**
5. **Department performance comparison**
