## 🔄 Data Flow

### **Gmail Workflow:**
```
User enters hours during onboarding
    ↓
Stored in profiles.client_config.rules.businessHours
    ↓
Deployment: formatBusinessHoursForAI() extracts and formats
    ↓
Injected as <<<OPERATING_HOURS>>> in gmail-template.json
    ↓
AI Draft Reply Agent node receives formatted hours
    ↓
AI uses hours to provide time-aware responses
```

### **Outlook Workflow:**
```
Same flow as Gmail, uses outlook-template.json instead
```

## 📊 Before vs. After Examples

### **Example 1: After-Hours Inquiry**

**Before:**
```
Customer: "Can I get a quote today?" (sent at 6 PM)
AI: "We'll get back to you soon."
```
❌ Vague, no timeline

**After:**
```
Customer: "Can I get a quote today?" (sent at 6 PM)
AI: "We're currently closed for the day (hours: 9 AM - 5 PM). 
     Mark will call you first thing tomorrow morning at 9 AM 
     with a quote."
```
✅ Specific time, sets expectations

---

### **Example 2: Emergency Contact**

**Before:**
```
Customer: "Water leaking from hot tub!" (sent at 10 PM)
AI: "Thanks for reaching out. We'll get back to you soon."
```
❌ DANGEROUS - no immediate help

**After:**
```
Customer: "Water leaking from hot tub!" (sent at 10 PM)
AI: "This sounds urgent! Since it's after hours, please call 
     our emergency line immediately at (403) 555-0123 for assistance.
     In the meantime, turn off your tub at the breaker to prevent
     further damage."
```
✅ HELPFUL - immediate action provided

---

### **Example 3: Service Area Check**

**Before:**
```
Customer: "Do you service Grande Prairie?"
AI: "Yes! We can schedule a visit."
```
❌ WRONG - accepting out-of-area jobs

**After:**
```
Customer: "Do you service Grande Prairie?"
AI: "We typically serve Red Deer, Sylvan Lake, Lacombe, and Leduc.
     Grande Prairie is outside our regular service area, but let me
     check with our team if we can accommodate a special trip.
     There may be additional travel fees."
```
✅ ACCURATE - sets correct expectations

---

### **Example 4: Holiday Scheduling**

**Before:**
```
Customer: "Can you come out December 26th?"
AI: "Sure! I'll have someone schedule that."
```
❌ Booking on closed day

**After:**
```
Customer: "Can you come out December 26th?"
AI: "We'll be closed December 25-26 for Christmas. Our first
     available date is December 27th. Would that work for you?"
```
✅ CORRECT - avoids scheduling conflict

---

### **Example 5: Social Media Engagement**

**Before:**
```
"Thanks so much for supporting our small business!
Best regards,
The Hot Tub Man Team
403-550-5140"
```

**After:**
```
"Thanks so much for supporting our small business!
Best regards,
The Hot Tub Man Team
403-550-5140"
