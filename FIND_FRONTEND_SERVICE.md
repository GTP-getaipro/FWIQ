# 🔍 Finding Your Frontend Service in Coolify

## The Mystery

You have:
- ✅ `FWIQBack` service → Deploys to `api.floworx-iq.com` (Backend)
- ❓ **Unknown service** → Deploys to `app.floworx-iq.com` (Frontend - OLD VERSION)

The frontend service exists somewhere in Coolify, but we need to find it!

## 🕵️ Investigation Steps

### **Step 1: Check Coolify Dashboard**

1. Click "Dashboard" in the left sidebar
2. Look at the main page - do you see multiple resources?
3. Each resource card shows:
   - Name
   - Status (Running/Stopped)
   - Domain
4. Look for one with domain: `app.floworx-iq.com`

---

### **Step 2: Check All Projects**

1. Click "Projects" in the left sidebar
2. You might have multiple projects
3. Click each project
4. Look inside for services with domain `app.floworx-iq.com`

---

### **Step 3: Check Servers**

1. Click "Servers" in the left sidebar
2. Click your server (probably "localhost")
3. You'll see ALL resources on that server
4. Look for anything serving `app.floworx-iq.com`

---

### **Step 4: Global Search**

1. Look for a search icon/bar in Coolify
2. Search for: `app.floworx-iq.com`
3. Or search for: `FWIQ`

---

## 🎯 Common Scenarios

### **Scenario A: Two Projects**

You might have:
- Project 1: "My first project" (Backend only)
- Project 2: "FloWorx" or "FWIQ-Frontend" (Frontend)

### **Scenario B: Two Environments**

Under "My first project":
- Environment: `production` (Backend)
- Environment: `frontend` (Frontend)

### **Scenario C: Static Site Service**

The frontend might be deployed as:
- "Static Site" (not "Application")
- Using Vercel/Netlify integration
- Or pointing to a pre-built `dist/` folder

---

## 💡 Quick Test

### **Check What's Actually Running:**

Open your browser and go to `app.floworx-iq.com`, then press F12 and run this in the Console:

```javascript
// Check build info
console.log('Build timestamp:', document.lastModified);

// Check if it's Vite build
const scripts = Array.from(document.scripts).map(s => s.src);
console.log('Scripts:', scripts);

// Look for Coolify deployment ID
const html = document.documentElement.outerHTML;
const coolifyMatch = html.match(/coolify|deployment|build/gi);
console.log('Coolify markers:', coolifyMatch);
```

This will tell us:
- When it was built
- How it's being served
- If there are any deployment markers

---

## 🔧 If You Can't Find It

If the frontend service is truly hidden or lost, we can:

### **Option A: Create a New Frontend Service**

1. Click "+ Add" in Coolify
2. Select "Application"
3. Configure:
   - Name: `FWIQ-Frontend`
   - Repository: `GTP-getaipro/FWIQ`
   - Branch: `master`
   - Dockerfile: `Dockerfile.frontend`
   - Port: `80`
   - Domain: `app.floworx-iq.com`

### **Option B: Update FWIQBack to Serve Both**

Modify `FWIQBack` to serve both frontend and backend (not recommended, but possible)

### **Option C: Deploy Frontend Separately**

Use Vercel, Netlify, or Cloudflare Pages for the frontend

---

## 📞 Next Steps

Once you find the frontend service, you need to:

1. ✅ Verify it's using branch: `master`
2. ✅ Verify it's using: `Dockerfile.frontend`
3. ✅ Click "Redeploy"
4. ✅ Watch logs for commit: `423ad97`
5. ✅ Clear browser cache
6. ✅ Test the new version

---

## 🎯 Summary

**What we know:**
- Backend is updated ✅ (`api.floworx-iq.com`)
- Frontend is NOT updated ❌ (`app.floworx-iq.com`)
- Code is pushed to GitHub ✅
- Database migrations are done ✅

**What we need:**
- Find the service deploying `app.floworx-iq.com`
- Redeploy it with latest code
- Verify it shows the new UI
