# 🎯 Multi-Department Implementation Checklist

## ✅ **COMPLETED COMPONENTS**

### **1. Frontend - Onboarding Flow**
- ✅ `src/pages/onboarding/StepDepartmentScope.jsx`
  - NEW dedicated step (Step 2) after OAuth
  - Multi-select checkboxes
  - Visual logic: When "All" checked, all boxes show checked
  - Data logic: Stores `['all']` OR `['sales', 'support']` etc.
  - Validation: At least one selection required

### **2. Frontend - Settings Modal**
- ✅ `src/components/SimplifiedDashboard.jsx`
  - Settings icon opens modal
  - Same department selector UI
  - Can change anytime
  - Prompts to redeploy after saving

### **3. Frontend - Dashboard Display**
- ✅ Department badge shows selected departments
  - "💰 Sales + 🛠️ Support Depts"
  - "🏢 Office Hub (All Departments)"

### **4. Frontend - Routing Updates**
- ✅ `src/pages/onboarding/OnboardingWizard.jsx`
  - Added Step 2: Department Scope
  - Progress bar shows 6 steps
  - Route: `/onboarding/department-scope`

- ✅ `src/pages/onboarding/Step2Email.jsx`
  - OAuth success navigates to department-scope
  - Sets onboarding_step to 'department_scope'

### **5. Database Schema**
- ✅ `supabase/migrations/20251030_add_department_scope.sql`
  - `business_profiles.department_scope` JSONB array
  - `workflows.department_scope` JSONB array
  - Default: `["all"]`
  - Comments and indexes

### **6. Backend - AI Filtering Logic**
- ✅ `supabase/functions/deploy-n8n/index.ts`
  - Reads `department_scope` from business_profiles
  - Maps departments to categories:
    - `all` → All categories
    - `sales` → SALES, FORMSUB
    - `support` → SUPPORT, URGENT
    - `operations` → MANAGER, SUPPLIERS, BANKING, RECRUITMENT
    - `urgent` → URGENT
  - Combines categories from multiple departments
  - Injects department filter into AI system message
  - AI returns OUT_OF_SCOPE for emails outside scope

---

## ⚠️ **MISSING/NEEDS VERIFICATION**

### **1. N8N Templates - NO CHANGES NEEDED** ✅
**Status:** TEMPLATES STAY THE SAME

**Clarification:**
- N8N templates remain unchanged
- They already handle ALL email categories including OUT_OF_SCOPE
- ONLY the AI system message changes based on user selection
- AI system message is dynamically injected by deploy-n8n Edge Function

**How It Works:**
1. User selects departments (e.g., Sales + Support)
2. deploy-n8n reads selection from business_profiles
3. deploy-n8n builds allowed categories (SALES, FORMSUB, SUPPORT, URGENT)
4. deploy-n8n injects department filter into AI system message
5. AI classifies emails using updated instructions
6. Emails outside scope → classified as OUT_OF_SCOPE
7. N8N template processes OUT_OF_SCOPE like any other category

---

### **2. Dashboard - Verify Multi-Department Display** ⚠️
**Status:** Need to test

**File:** `src/components/SimplifiedDashboard.jsx`

**Current Code:**
```jsx
{departmentScope.map((dept, index) => (
  <span key={dept}>
    {dept === 'sales' && '💰'}
    {dept === 'support' && '🛠️'}
    {dept === 'operations' && '⚙️'}
    {dept === 'urgent' && '🚨'}
    <span className="ml-1 capitalize">{dept}</span>
    {index < departmentScope.length - 1 && <span className="mx-1">+</span>}
  </span>
))}
```

**Test Cases:**
- ✅ `['all']` → Shows "Office Hub (All Departments)"
- ❓ `['sales']` → Should show "💰 Sales Dept"
- ❓ `['sales', 'support']` → Should show "💰 Sales + 🛠️ Support Depts"
- ❓ `['operations', 'urgent']` → Should show "⚙️ Operations + 🚨 Urgent Depts"

---

### **3. Backend - AI System Message Templates** ⚠️
**Status:** IMPLEMENTED but needs verification

**File:** `supabase/functions/deploy-n8n/index.ts`

**What It Does:**
- Line ~380-450: Department filtering logic
- Builds allowed categories from selected departments
- Injects filter instructions into AI system message
- Example output:
```
🎯 DEPARTMENT SCOPE RESTRICTION - CRITICAL
THIS WORKFLOW HANDLES: Sales + Support
ALLOWED CATEGORIES FOR CLASSIFICATION:
  ✅ SALES
  ✅ FORMSUB
  ✅ SUPPORT
  ✅ URGENT

FOR ANY EMAIL THAT DOES NOT FIT THE ABOVE CATEGORIES:
Return: {"primary_category": "OUT_OF_SCOPE", ...}
```

**Verification Needed:**
- ✅ Logic exists
- ❓ Test with real AI classification
- ❓ Verify OUT_OF_SCOPE responses work

---

### **4. Workflow Redeployment Flow** ⚠️
**Status:** Need to document/test

**Current Flow:**
1. User changes department scope in Settings
2. Saves to `business_profiles.department_scope`
3. Toast: "Redeploy your workflow to apply changes"
4. User clicks "Deploy" button
5. ❓ Does deploy-n8n Edge Function read NEW department_scope?
6. ❓ Does it update existing workflow with new AI message?

**Test:**
- Change from "All" to "Sales only"
- Redeploy
- Verify AI message updated
- Verify OUT_OF_SCOPE classification works

---

### **5. Error Handling** ⚠️
**Current Error Seen:**
```
null value in column "primary_business_type" violates not-null constraint
```

**Issue:**
- `business_profiles` table requires `primary_business_type`
- Step 2 (Department Scope) saves before Step 3 (Business Type)
- Need to handle this dependency

**Solutions:**
A. Make `primary_business_type` nullable ✅
B. Set a default value like "pending"
C. Wait to save department_scope until business type selected ❌

**Recommended:** Make column nullable or set default

---

### **6. Testing Matrix** ❌
**Status:** No tests yet

**Test Scenarios:**

| Scenario | Department Scope | Expected AI Categories | Expected OUT_OF_SCOPE |
|----------|------------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| Office Hub | `['all']` | ALL | None |
| Sales Only | `['sales']` | SALES, FORMSUB | SUPPORT, MANAGER, etc. |
| Support Only | `['support']` | SUPPORT, URGENT | SALES, MANAGER, etc. |
| Sales + Support | `['sales', 'support']` | SALES, FORMSUB, SUPPORT, URGENT | MANAGER, BANKING, etc. |
| Operations | `['operations']` | MANAGER, SUPPLIERS, BANKING, RECRUITMENT | SALES, SUPPORT |

**Action:** Create test plan and validate

---

## 🚀 **IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS**

   - Templates stay the same
   - AI system message changes dynamically
   - Already implemented in deploy-n8n

2. ✅ **Fix database constraint error**
   - Created migration: `20251030_fix_primary_business_type_nullable.sql`
   - Makes `primary_business_type` nullable
   - Allows Step 2 to save before Step 3

### **Priority 2: Important**
3. ⚠️ **Test multi-department dashboard display**
   - Deploy and verify badge shows correctly
   - Test with different combinations

4. ⚠️ **Test redeployment flow**
   - Change department scope
   - Redeploy workflow
   - Verify AI filtering works

### **Priority 3: Nice to Have**
5. ❌ **Create comprehensive testing matrix**
   - Document test scenarios
   - Test each combination
   - Verify OUT_OF_SCOPE handling

6. ❌ **Add logging/monitoring**
   - Log department scope decisions
   - Track OUT_OF_SCOPE classifications
   - Monitor edge cases
