# ‚úÖ Custom Form Links Implementation - COMPLETE

## üéØ What Was Fixed

The AI now uses **YOUR custom form links** from the onboarding UI instead of hardcoded URLs!

---

## üìã Changes Made

### 1. **Backend: Supabase Edge Function** (`supabase/functions/deploy-n8n/index.ts`)

**Added:**
- `buildCallToActionFromForms()` function to intelligently map form labels to inquiry types
- Extract `formLinks` from `client_config.contact.formLinks`
- Inject dynamic call-to-action options into N8N workflow template

**Lines 78-133:**
```typescript
function buildCallToActionFromForms(formLinks: any[], business: any): string {
  // Maps your form labels to common inquiry types:
  // - "Repair Request" ‚Üí Service booking
  // - "Product Information" ‚Üí Product browsing
  // - "Hot Tub Covers" ‚Üí Cover ordering
  // - "Supplies and accessories" ‚Üí Parts ordering
  // - etc.
}
```

**Lines 1515-1520:**
```typescript
// Extract custom form links from client_config
const formLinks = clientData.contact?.formLinks || 
                  clientData.client_config?.contact?.formLinks || [];

// Build dynamic call-to-action section from custom form links
const callToActionOptions = buildCallToActionFromForms(formLinks, business);
```

**Line 1534:**
```typescript
'<<<CALL_TO_ACTION_OPTIONS>>>': callToActionOptions,
```

---

### 2. **Frontend: Template Injector** (`src/lib/directTemplateInjector.js`)

**Added:**
- `buildCallToActionFromForms()` method (lines 305-370)
- Extract `formLinks` from multiple fallback locations
- Inject into template replacements (line 289)

**Lines 249-250:**
```javascript
// CRITICAL FIX: Build call-to-action options from custom form links
const callToActionOptions = this.buildCallToActionFromForms(clientData);
```

---

### 3. **AI System Message Templates**

**Updated 3 files to use dynamic placeholders:**

#### `src/lib/goldStandardReplyPrompt.js` (Lines 212-216)
```markdown
3. **Clear next step / call to action:**
   {{CALL_TO_ACTION_OPTIONS}}
   
   Note: Use these links to guide customers to the right forms based on their inquiry type.
```

#### `src/lib/hotTubManAIDraftAgentSystemMessage.js` (Lines 226-230)
```markdown
3. **Clear next step / call to action**
   <<<CALL_TO_ACTION_OPTIONS>>>
   
   Note: Use these links to guide customers to the right forms based on their inquiry type.
```

#### `src/lib/multiBusinessAIDraftAgentSystemMessage.js` (Lines 225-229)
```markdown
3. **Clear next step / call to action**
   <<<CALL_TO_ACTION_OPTIONS>>>
   
   Note: Use these links to guide customers to the right forms based on their inquiry type.
```

## üìä AI Decision Flow

**When a customer email arrives:**

1. **Email:** "My hot tub heater is broken"
2. **AI Classifies:** Support > TechnicalSupport
3. **AI Selects:** "Schedule a service call ‚Üí https://www.thehottubman.ca/repairs"
4. **Customer Reply:**
   ```
   Hi Sarah,
   
   I can help with your heater issue. The best next step is to 
   schedule a service call so our technician can diagnose the problem.
   
   Please fill out our service form here:
   https://www.thehottubman.ca/repairs
   
   Thanks!
   The Hot Tub Man Team
   ```
