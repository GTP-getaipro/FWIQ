## üêõ Error Scenarios

### **Error 1: Migration Not Run**

**Symptom:** Department selector doesn't save, console errors

**Check:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'business_profiles' 
AND column_name = 'department_scope';
```

**Fix:** Run migration

---

### **Error 2: Edge Function Not Updated**

**Symptom:** AI doesn't filter categories, processes all emails

**Check:**
```bash
supabase functions logs deploy-n8n
# Look for: "üè¢ Department Scope: sales"
```

**Fix:** Redeploy edge function

---

### **Error 3: Dashboard Badge Not Showing**

**Symptom:** Badge doesn't appear or shows wrong department

**Check:**
- Frontend deployed?
- Browser cache cleared?
- Department scope saved to database?

**Fix:**
```bash
# Clear cache
Ctrl+Shift+R (hard refresh)

# Check database
SELECT department_scope FROM business_profiles WHERE user_id = 'xxx';

# Redeploy frontend
```
