# âœ… REFACTORED: Business-Specific Technical Support Categories

## ðŸŽ¯ **TechnicalSupport â†’ Business-Specific Categories**

You were absolutely right! "TechnicalSupport" was too generic and didn't make sense for all 12 business types. I've refactored it to be **business-specific**.

---

## ðŸ“Š **New SUPPORT Structure**

### **Base Categories (All Businesses Get These 2):**
1. `AppointmentScheduling` - Booking/rescheduling/canceling visits
2. `General` - Other support inquiries

### **Business-Specific Technical Support Categories:**

| Business Type | Technical Support Category | Description |
|---------------|---------------------------|-------------|
| **Hot Tub & Spa** | `SpaRepair` | Spa equipment repair and troubleshooting |
| **Electrician** | `ElectricalRepair` | Electrical system repair and troubleshooting |
| **HVAC** | `HVACRepair` | HVAC system repair and troubleshooting |
| **Plumber** | `PlumbingRepair` | Plumbing system repair and troubleshooting |
| **Pools** | `PoolTroubleshooting` | Pool system troubleshooting and repair |
| **Roofing** | `RoofRepair` | Roof repair and maintenance services |
| **Painting** | `PaintIssues` | Paint problems and touch-up services |
| **Flooring** | `FlooringIssues` | Flooring problems and maintenance |
| **Landscaping** | `LandscapeMaintenance` | Landscape maintenance and care issues |
| **General Construction** | `ConstructionIssues` | Construction problems and quality issues |
| **Insulation & Foam Spray** | `InsulationIssues` | Insulation problems and performance issues |
| **Sauna & Icebath** | `SaunaIceBathIssues` | Sauna and ice bath system problems |
