# OAuth State Reset Fix - Connect Gmail/Outlook

## 🔴 Problem

When users clicked "Connect Gmail" or "Connect Outlook" and then:
- Cancelled the OAuth popup
- Closed the OAuth window
- Clicked "Cancel" on Google/Microsoft consent page
- Experienced an OAuth error

**The button would stay stuck in "loading" state** (spinning icon, disabled) even though no connection was made.

Users had to refresh the page manually to try again.

---

## ✅ Solution

Added multiple mechanisms to automatically reset the loading state:

### **1. Window Focus Detection**
- Detects when user returns to the page (after closing OAuth popup)
- Checks if OAuth was successful (looks for URL parameters)
- Resets loading state if OAuth didn't complete after 3 seconds

### **2. Visibility Change Detection**
- Detects when the page becomes visible again
- Checks elapsed time since OAuth started
- Resets loading state if more than 5 seconds passed without success

### **3. Timeout Fallback**
- 30-second timeout starts when OAuth is initiated
- Automatically resets loading state if OAuth doesn't complete
- Handles edge cases where focus/visibility events don't fire

### **4. Stale State Cleanup**
- On component mount, checks for stale OAuth state
- Cleans up sessionStorage from previous failed attempts
- Ensures fresh state on page reload

### **5. Success Cleanup**
- When OAuth completes successfully, clears all tracking data
- Prevents false positives from triggering reset mechanisms

## 🔧 How It Works

### **When User Clicks "Connect Gmail":**

```javascript
1. Button shows loading spinner (disabled)
2. Store provider and timestamp in sessionStorage
3. Open OAuth popup/redirect
4. Start 30-second timeout
```

### **If User Cancels OAuth:**

**Scenario A: User closes popup and comes back**
```javascript
1. Window focus event fires
2. Check: Is OAuth complete? No
3. Check: How long has it been? > 3 seconds
4. Reset loading state → Button becomes clickable again ✅
5. Clean up sessionStorage
6. Refresh connections to get accurate state
```

**Scenario B: User switches tabs and comes back**
```javascript
1. Visibility change event fires
2. Check: Is OAuth complete? No
3. Check: How long has it been? > 5 seconds
4. Reset loading state → Button becomes clickable again ✅
5. Clean up sessionStorage
6. Refresh connections
```

**Scenario C: User doesn't come back**
```javascript
1. 30-second timeout fires
2. Check: Is OAuth complete? No
3. Reset loading state → Button becomes clickable again ✅
4. Clean up sessionStorage
```

### **If User Refreshes Page:**

```javascript
1. Component mounts
2. Check sessionStorage for stale OAuth state
3. If found: Clean up and reset loading state
4. Fetch actual connection status
5. Show correct button state ✅
```

### **If OAuth Succeeds:**

```javascript
1. OAuth callback completes
2. Integration verified
3. Clean up sessionStorage
4. Reset all loading states
5. Show success message ✅
```

## 📊 Technical Details

### **SessionStorage Keys Used:**
- `oauth_connecting_provider` - Which provider is being connected (gmail/outlook)
- `oauth_connection_timestamp` - When the OAuth flow started

### **Timeouts:**
- **3 seconds** - Window focus check (user likely cancelled)
- **5 seconds** - Visibility change check (user switched away)
- **30 seconds** - Fallback timeout (handles all edge cases)

### **Events Listened To:**
- `window.focus` - User comes back to the window
- `document.visibilitychange` - Page becomes visible/hidden
- `setTimeout` - Fallback timeout mechanism

## 🧪 Testing the Fix

### **Test 1: Cancel OAuth Popup**
1. Click "Connect Gmail"
2. Wait for Google OAuth popup
3. Close the popup (X button)
4. Come back to the page
5. ✅ Button should reset to clickable state within 3 seconds

### **Test 2: Click Cancel on OAuth Page**
1. Click "Connect Outlook"
2. Microsoft OAuth page opens
3. Click "Cancel"
4. Return to FloWorx
5. ✅ Button should reset to clickable state

### **Test 3: Switch Tabs During OAuth**
1. Click "Connect Gmail"
2. Switch to another tab immediately
3. Wait 5+ seconds
4. Switch back to FloWorx tab
5. ✅ Button should be reset

### **Test 4: Page Refresh**
1. Click "Connect Gmail"
2. Refresh the page before OAuth completes
3. ✅ Button should be in normal state (not loading)

### **Test 5: Successful OAuth**
1. Click "Connect Gmail"
2. Complete the OAuth flow
3. Return to page
4. ✅ Button shows as connected
5. ✅ No stale state in sessionStorage

## 🎯 User Experience Improvements

**Before:**
- ❌ Button stuck in loading state
- ❌ User has to refresh page manually
- ❌ Confusing UX - looks broken
- ❌ Can't retry connection

**After:**
- ✅ Button automatically resets
- ✅ User can try again immediately
- ✅ Clear feedback - button is ready
- ✅ No manual refresh needed
- ✅ Professional, polished experience

## 📝 Files Modified

**`src/pages/onboarding/Step2Email.jsx`**
- Added window focus listener
- Added visibility change listener
- Added 30-second timeout fallback
- Added stale state cleanup on mount
- Added cleanup on successful OAuth
- Updated `handleConnect` function

---

## 🔒 Edge Cases Handled

✅ **User closes OAuth popup**
✅ **User clicks "Cancel" on OAuth page**
✅ **User switches tabs during OAuth**
✅ **User refreshes page during OAuth**
✅ **OAuth fails with error**
✅ **Network timeout during OAuth**
✅ **Browser blocks popup**
✅ **Multiple rapid clicks** (state cleanup prevents conflicts)

---

## 💡 Additional Improvements

### **Future Enhancements (Optional):**
- Show "Cancelled" message briefly when OAuth is cancelled
- Track cancellation analytics
- Adjust timeouts based on provider (Google vs Microsoft)
- Add retry with exponential backoff
- Show progress indicator during OAuth

### **Monitoring:**
- Log OAuth cancellations for analytics
- Track success/failure rates
- Monitor average OAuth completion time

---

## ✅ Summary

**The Fix:**
Multiple overlapping mechanisms ensure the loading state always resets:
1. Window focus detection (3s delay)
2. Visibility change detection (5s delay)
3. Timeout fallback (30s)
4. Stale state cleanup on mount
5. Success cleanup on completion

**Result:**
- 🎯 Users can retry OAuth immediately after cancelling
- 🎯 No stuck buttons or broken UI states
- 🎯 Professional, polished user experience
- 🎯 Works in all scenarios and edge cases
