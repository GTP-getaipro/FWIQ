# Auto-Forward to Manager Email - Feature Design

## 🎯 Feature: Automatic Email Forwarding

**Rule:**
- ✅ If manager email is specified → **Forward email to manager + Label in folder**
- ✅ If manager email is NOT specified → **Label in folder only (no forwarding)**

---

## 📊 How It Works

### **Scenario A: Manager Email Specified**

**Setup:**
```
Mark Johnson
├─ Email: mark@hottubman.ca ✅ (specified)
└─ Roles: Sales Manager
```

**When SALES email arrives:**
```
1. AI classifies: SALES > NewInquiry
2. Routes to: Mark Johnson (Sales Manager)
3. Actions:
   ✅ Apply Gmail/Outlook label: MANAGER/Mark Johnson/
   ✅ Forward email to: mark@hottubman.ca
   ✅ Mark receives email in his personal inbox
   ✅ Email also appears in main inbox with label
```

**Result:**
- Mark gets email notification instantly
- Email is labeled and organized
- Mark can respond from his own inbox or main business inbox

---

### **Scenario B: Manager Email NOT Specified**

**Setup:**
```
Sarah Williams
├─ Email: (blank) ❌ (not specified)
└─ Roles: Service Manager
```

**When SUPPORT email arrives:**
```
1. AI classifies: SUPPORT > TechnicalSupport
2. Routes to: Sarah Williams (Service Manager)
3. Actions:
   ✅ Apply Gmail/Outlook label: MANAGER/Sarah Williams/
   ❌ No forwarding (email field is blank)
   ✅ Email stays in main business inbox only
```

**Result:**
- Email is labeled and organized
- Sarah checks the main business inbox
- No duplicate emails sent

---

## 🔄 Complete Email Flow

### **Example 1: Sales Email with Forwarding**

**Customer sends:**
```
To: info@hottubman.ca
Subject: "Interested in buying a hot tub"
Body: "How much for a 6-person spa?"
```

**N8N Workflow Processing:**
```
Step 1: Fetch Email
→ Email received in main inbox

Step 2: AI Classification
→ Category: SALES > NewInquiry
→ Confidence: 0.93
→ ai_can_reply: true

Step 3: Role Matching
→ SALES category matches: Sales Manager role
→ Manager: Mark Johnson (mark@hottubman.ca)
→ Has email: YES ✅

Step 4: Apply Label
→ Gmail API: Create label "MANAGER/Mark Johnson"
→ Apply label to email
→ Email now in: Inbox AND MANAGER/Mark Johnson/

Step 5: Forward Email ⭐ NEW!
→ Gmail API: Forward email to mark@hottubman.ca
→ Subject: "Fwd: Interested in buying a hot tub"
→ From: info@hottubman.ca
→ To: mark@hottubman.ca
→ Mark receives in his personal inbox

Step 6: Draft AI Reply
→ Generate reply
→ Save to drafts
→ Await human review
```

**What Mark sees:**
```
Mark's Personal Inbox (mark@hottubman.ca):
📧 New Email
From: info@hottubman.ca (Fwd from FloWorx)
Subject: Fwd: Interested in buying a hot tub
Body: Customer inquiry about 6-person spa...

Mark can:
✅ Reply directly from his inbox
✅ Or check main business inbox for AI draft
```

---

### **Example 2: Service Email WITHOUT Forwarding**

**Customer sends:**
```
To: info@hottubman.ca
Subject: "Hot tub heater not working"
Body: "Jets are fine but no heat"
```

**N8N Workflow Processing:**
```
Step 1: Fetch Email
→ Email received in main inbox

Step 2: AI Classification
→ Category: SUPPORT > TechnicalSupport
→ Confidence: 0.91

Step 3: Role Matching
→ SUPPORT category matches: Service Manager role
→ Manager: Sarah Williams (no email specified)
→ Has email: NO ❌

Step 4: Apply Label
→ Gmail API: Create label "MANAGER/Sarah Williams"
→ Apply label to email
→ Email now in: Inbox AND MANAGER/Sarah Williams/

Step 5: Skip Forwarding
→ No manager email specified
→ Skip forwarding step
→ Email stays in main inbox only

Step 6: Draft AI Reply
→ Generate reply
→ Save to drafts
```

**What happens:**
```
Main Business Inbox (info@hottubman.ca):
📧 Email labeled: MANAGER/Sarah Williams/
Sarah checks folder filter to see her emails
```

---

## 🔧 N8N Workflow Implementation

### **New Node: "Forward to Manager (Conditional)"**

**Position:** After "Apply Gmail Label" node

**Logic:**
```javascript
// Code node: Check if manager email exists
const manager = $json.matched_manager;
const managerEmail = manager?.email;

if (managerEmail && managerEmail.trim() !== '') {
  return [{
    json: {
      shouldForward: true,
      forwardTo: managerEmail,
      managerName: manager.name,
      originalEmail: $('Prepare Email Data').first().json
    }
  }];
} else {
  return [{
    json: {
      shouldForward: false,
      managerName: manager?.name || 'Unknown',
      reason: 'no_email_specified'
    }
  }];
}
```

**If `shouldForward = true`:**
```javascript
// Gmail: Forward email
POST https://gmail.googleapis.com/gmail/v1/users/me/messages/{messageId}/forward
{
  "to": "{{$json.forwardTo}}",
  "subject": "Fwd: {{$('Prepare Email Data').first().json.subject}}",
  "body": "This email has been routed to you based on your role.\n\n--- Original Email ---\n{{$('Prepare Email Data').first().json.body}}"
}
```

**If `shouldForward = false`:**
```javascript
// Skip forwarding, continue to next node
```

## 📧 Gmail/Outlook Forwarding Rules

### **Gmail API (Forwarding):**

```javascript
// N8N Gmail node
{
  "operation": "forward",
  "messageId": "{{$json.messageId}}",
  "to": "{{$json.managerEmail}}",
  "subject": "Fwd: {{$json.originalSubject}}",
  "body": `This email has been routed to you as ${$json.matchedRole}.

--- Original Email ---
From: {{$json.from}}
To: {{$json.to}}
Subject: {{$json.originalSubject}}

{{$json.body}}`
}
```

### **Outlook API (Forwarding):**

```javascript
// N8N Outlook node
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/messages/{messageId}/forward
{
  "toRecipients": [
    {
      "emailAddress": {
        "address": "{{$json.managerEmail}}"
      }
    }
  ],
  "comment": "This email has been routed to you based on your role: {{$json.matchedRole}}"

## 📊 Database Schema (Email Field)

```javascript
managers: [
  {
    name: "Mark Johnson",
    email: "mark@hottubman.ca",        // ← Optional field
    roles: ["Sales Manager", "Operations Manager"],
    forward_emails: true,               // ← Auto-set based on email presence
    forwarding_config: {
      enabled: true,
      forward_to: "mark@hottubman.ca",
      include_ai_draft: false,          // Future: Include AI draft in forward
      notification_only: false          // Future: Just notify, don't include full email
    }
  },
  {
    name: "Sarah Williams",
    email: "",                          // ← Blank = no forwarding
    roles: ["Service Manager"],
    forward_emails: false,              // ← Auto-set to false
    forwarding_config: {
      enabled: false
    }
  }
]
```

## 🧠 AI Routing Decision Logic (Updated)

```typescript
### Enhanced Routing Logic:

Step 1: Classify email (SALES, SUPPORT, MANAGER, etc.)

Step 2: Check for name mention
→ If "Mark" detected → Route to Mark Johnson

Step 3: If no name, match category to role
→ SALES → Sales Manager (Mark Johnson)
→ SUPPORT → Service Manager (Sarah Williams)
→ MANAGER + vendor keywords → Operations Manager

Step 4: Apply label
→ Gmail/Outlook label: MANAGER/${manager.name}/

Step 5: Check if manager email exists ⭐ NEW!
→ If manager.email exists:
  ✅ Forward email to manager.email
  ✅ Log: "Email forwarded to {manager.email}"
→ If manager.email is blank:
  ✅ Skip forwarding
  ✅ Log: "Email labeled only (no forwarding address)"

Step 6: Generate AI draft reply
→ Save to drafts in main inbox
```

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### **N8N Workflow Nodes:**

#### **1. Manager Email Check (Code Node)**

```javascript
// After role-based routing decision
const manager = $json.matched_manager;
const managerEmail = manager?.email;

// Check if email exists and is valid
const hasValidEmail = managerEmail && 
                     managerEmail.trim() !== '' && 
                     managerEmail.includes('@');

return [{
  json: {
    manager: manager,
    shouldForward: hasValidEmail,
    forwardTo: hasValidEmail ? managerEmail : null,
    managerName: manager?.name || 'Unknown',
    labelPath: `MANAGER/${manager?.name || 'Unassigned'}/`
  }
}];
```

#### **2. Conditional Forward (IF Node)**

```javascript
// IF condition
{{$json.shouldForward}} === true
```

**True Branch → Gmail/Outlook Forward Node:**
```javascript
// CRITICAL FIX: Include AI draft response if ai_can_reply = true
const aiCanReply = $json.ai_can_reply;
const aiDraftResponse = $('AI Draft Reply Agent').item.json.draft_response;

let forwardBody = '';

// If AI generated a draft, include it at the top
if (aiCanReply && aiDraftResponse) {
  forwardBody = `🤖 AI SUGGESTED RESPONSE (Review & Approve):
═══════════════════════════════════════════
${aiDraftResponse}
═══════════════════════════════════════════

--- ORIGINAL CUSTOMER EMAIL ---
From: {{$('Prepare Email Data').first().json.from}}
Subject: {{$('Prepare Email Data').first().json.subject}}
Date: {{$('Prepare Email Data').first().json.date}}

{{$('Prepare Email Data').first().json.body}}
─────────────────────────────────────────

💡 To send this reply:
1. Review AI draft above
2. Edit if needed  
3. Reply to customer using the draft
`;
} else {
  // No AI draft available
  forwardBody = `This email has been routed to you based on your role: {{$json.matchedRole}}

Manager: {{$json.managerName}}
Routing Reason: {{$json.routing_reason}}

--- Original Email ---
From: {{$('Prepare Email Data').first().json.from}}
Subject: {{$('Prepare Email Data').first().json.subject}}

{{$('Prepare Email Data').first().json.body}}
`;
}

// Gmail Forward
{
  "messageId": "{{$('Prepare Email Data').first().json.id}}",
  "to": "{{$json.forwardTo}}",
  "subject": "Fwd: {{$('Prepare Email Data').first().json.subject}}",
  "body": forwardBody
}
```

**False Branch → Skip to Next Node**

### **3. Gmail Forward Function**

```typescript
async function forwardEmailToManager(messageId, managerEmail, emailData, provider, accessToken) {

              emailAddress: { address: managerEmail }
            }],
            comment: `This email has been routed to you based on your role.`
          })

}
```

---

## ⚡ Advanced Features (Future)

### **1. Forwarding Preferences (Per Manager)**

```javascript
forwarding_config: {
  enabled: true,
  forward_to: "mark@hottubman.ca",
  include_ai_draft: true,           // Include AI draft in forward
  notification_only: false,         // Just notify, don't forward full email
  forward_urgent_only: false,       // Only forward URGENT category
  business_hours_only: false        // Only forward during business hours
}
```

### **2. Notification-Only Mode**

Instead of forwarding full email, send summary:
```
Subject: New Email Routed to You
Body:
  You have a new SALES inquiry assigned to you.
  
  From: customer@email.com
  Subject: "How much for a hot tub?"
  
  View in main inbox: MANAGER/Mark Johnson/ folder
  AI Draft Available: Yes
```

### **3. Digest Mode**

Instead of forwarding each email, send daily digest:
```
Subject: Daily Email Summary - 5 new emails

You received 5 emails today:
1. SALES > NewInquiry - "Interested in hot tub"
2. SALES > QuoteRequest - "Need pricing for commercial account"
3. MANAGER > Vendor - "Supplier partnership inquiry"
...

Check MANAGER/Mark Johnson/ folder for details.
```

  ✅ Forward to: mark@hottubman.ca
  
- Email B:
  ✅ Route to: Mark (Operations role)
  ✅ Forward to: mark@hottubman.ca (same address)
  
Result: Mark gets both emails forwarded to same inbox ✅

## 📋 UI Validation Rules

### **Email Field Validation:**

```javascript
// Validate manager email
const validateManagerEmail = (email) => {
  if (!email || email.trim() === '') {
    return { 
      valid: true,  // Blank is allowed
      message: 'Email forwarding disabled (blank email)'
    };
  }
  
  if (!email.includes('@')) {
    return {
      valid: false,
      message: 'Please enter a valid email address'
    };
  }
  
  // Check if email domain matches business domain
  const emailDomain = email.split('@')[1];
  const businessDomain = businessInfo.emailDomain;
  
  if (emailDomain === businessDomain) {
    return {
      valid: true,
      warning: 'This is the same domain as your business inbox. Emails will forward to same account.'
    };
  }
  
  return {
    valid: true,
    message: 'Email forwarding enabled'
  };
};
```

## 🎯 Summary

### **The Rule:**
```
IF manager.email exists AND is valid:
  ✅ Forward email to manager's personal inbox
  ✅ Apply label: MANAGER/${manager.name}/
  
ELSE:
  ✅ Apply label: MANAGER/${manager.name}/
  ❌ No forwarding
```

### **Benefits:**
- ✅ Flexible for different team structures
- ✅ Solo owners can leave email blank
- ✅ Remote workers can get forwarded emails
- ✅ Office workers can check main inbox
- ✅ Hybrid teams can mix both approaches

### **Implementation:**
1. Make email field optional in UI
2. Add forwarding logic to N8N workflow
3. Conditional "Forward to Manager" node
4. Gmail/Outlook forward API integration
5. Logging and error handling
