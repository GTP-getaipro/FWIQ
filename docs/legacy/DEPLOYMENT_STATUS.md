## 📦 What Was Deployed

### Code Changes (2 files)

#### 1. ✅ `src/pages/onboarding/Step3BusinessType.jsx`
**What changed**: Added defensive error handling for voice analysis  
**Impact**: Voice analysis won't crash if database schema is incomplete  

**Changes**:
- Wrapped all `communication_styles` inserts in try-catch blocks
- Added helpful warning messages when schema is incomplete
- Graceful fallbacks for status updates

#### 2. ✅ `src/lib/labelProvisionService.js`
**What changed**: Auto-creates business_profile if missing  
**Impact**: Folder provisioning works even if business_profile doesn't exist yet  

**Changes**:
- Checks for existing business_profile
- Auto-creates with business type, managers, and suppliers if missing
- No more "No business profile found" errors

## 🎯 What's Fixed (Frontend)

| Issue | Status | Solution |
|-------|--------|----------|
| 400 Bad Request on `communication_styles` | ✅ Partially Fixed | Frontend has defensive error handling |
| 406 Not Acceptable on `business_profiles` | ✅ **FULLY FIXED** | Auto-creates business_profile |
| Voice analysis crashes | ✅ **FIXED** | Graceful error handling |
| Folder provisioning failures | ✅ **FIXED** | Auto-creates missing profile |

## ⚠️ Remaining Database Fix (1 minute)

You still need to run **ONE SQL command** in Supabase to fully resolve the `style_profile` constraint issue:

### Run This in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Make style_profile nullable
ALTER TABLE communication_styles 
ALTER COLUMN style_profile DROP NOT NULL;

-- Verify
SELECT '✅ Fixed: style_profile is now nullable' as status;
```

**Why**: The `style_profile` column is currently `NOT NULL` but frontend needs to insert rows without it initially (gets populated later by voice analysis).
