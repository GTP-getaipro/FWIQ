## 🔄 How It Works

### **Complete Email Flow:**

```
1. Email arrives at info@hottubman.ca
   ↓
2. AI classifies: SALES > NewInquiry
   ↓
3. Role matching: Sales Manager (Mark Johnson)
   ↓
4. Apply label: MANAGER/Mark Johnson/
   ↓
5. AI generates draft (if ai_can_reply = true)
   ↓
6. Build forward email body:
   - Include AI draft at top
   - Include classification metadata
   - Include original customer email
   ↓
7. Check: Does Mark have email?
   ├─ YES (mark@personal.com) → Forward email WITH AI draft
   └─ NO (blank) → Skip forwarding
   ↓
8. Create draft in main inbox
   ↓
9. Save performance metrics
```
