# Configuration
$userId = "fedf818f-986f-4b30-bfa1-7fc339c7bb60"  # Replace with your user ID
$accessToken = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"  # Get from database or OAuth flow

# Folders to delete

Write-Host "üóëÔ∏è Starting Outlook folder cleanup..." -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host ""

# Get all folders
Write-Host "üìã Fetching folders from Outlook..." -ForegroundColor Yellow
$headers = @{
    "Authorization" = "Bearer $accessToken"
    "Content-Type" = "application/json"
}

try {
    $response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/mailFolders" -Headers $headers -Method Get
    $allFolders = $response.value
    
    Write-Host "   Found $($allFolders.Count) total folders" -ForegroundColor Gray
    Write-Host ""
    
    # Filter FloWorx folders
    $floworxFolders = $allFolders | Where-Object { $foldersToDelete -contains $_.displayName }
    
    Write-Host "üéØ Found $($floworxFolders.Count) FloWorx folders to delete:" -ForegroundColor Cyan
    foreach ($folder in $floworxFolders) {
        Write-Host "   - $($folder.displayName)" -ForegroundColor White
    }
    Write-Host ""
    
    # Delete each folder
    $deletedCount = 0
    foreach ($folder in $floworxFolders) {
        Write-Host "üóëÔ∏è  Deleting: $($folder.displayName)..." -ForegroundColor Yellow
        
        try {

    Write-Host "============================================================" -ForegroundColor Cyan
    
}
catch {
    Write-Host "‚ùå Error: $($_.Exception.Message)" -ForegroundColor Red
}
```

### **Step 2: Get Your Access Token**

Run this query in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
SELECT access_token 
FROM integrations 
WHERE user_id = 'fedf818f-986f-4b30-bfa1-7fc339c7bb60' 
  AND provider = 'outlook' 
  AND status = 'active';
```

### **Step 3: Run the Script**

## üßπ Clean Up Database Records Too

After deleting folders from Outlook, also clean the database:

### **SQL Script:**

```sql
-- Delete Outlook folder records from business_labels
DELETE FROM business_labels
WHERE user_id = 'fedf818f-986f-4b30-bfa1-7fc339c7bb60'
  AND provider = 'outlook';

-- Verify deletion
SELECT COUNT(*) as remaining_labels
FROM business_labels
WHERE user_id = 'fedf818f-986f-4b30-bfa1-7fc339c7bb60'
  AND provider = 'outlook';
```

Run this in the **Supabase SQL Editor**.

## üîÑ Start Fresh After Deletion

Once folders are deleted:

### **Step 1: Reconnect Outlook**
1. Go to your onboarding flow or settings
2. Click "Connect Outlook" again
3. Complete OAuth authorization

### **Step 2: Provision Fresh Folders**
The system will create brand new folders:

- Fresh GUIDs

### **Step 3: Verify**
Check Outlook to see the newly created folders.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### **What Happens to Emails:**
- Emails in these folders will be **moved to Deleted Items**
- You can recover them from **Deleted Items** for 30 days
- After 30 days, they're permanently deleted

### **Backup First (Optional):**
If you have important emails in these folders:

1. **Move emails to another folder** before deleting
2. **Export to PST file** (Outlook desktop)
3. **Archive important emails** to another location

### **Cannot Undo:**
- Folder deletion is **immediate**
- Can only restore from **Deleted Items** folder
- After 30 days, recovery is not possible

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### **Error: "Access token expired"**
**Solution:**
1. Reconnect your Outlook integration
2. Get a fresh access token
3. Run the script again

### **Error: "Folder not found"**
**Meaning:** Folder was already deleted or doesn't exist
**Action:** Continue with next folder (not an error)

### **Error: "Insufficient permissions"**
**Solution:**
1. Reconnect Outlook with full permissions
2. Ensure `Mail.ReadWrite` scope is granted
3. Try again

### **Some Folders Won't Delete**
**Possible Reasons:**
- System folders (can't be deleted)
- Folders with active rules
- Folders shared with others

**Solution:** Delete manually via Outlook web interface

## üéØ Recommended Workflow

**For Clean Start:**

```bash
# 1. Delete folders
node delete-outlook-folders.js fedf818f-986f-4b30-bfa1-7fc339c7bb60

# 2. Clear database
# Run SQL in Supabase:
# DELETE FROM business_labels WHERE user_id = '...' AND provider = 'outlook';

# 3. Reconnect Outlook
# Use your app's OAuth flow

# 4. Provision fresh folders
