# 🔧 OAuth Integration RLS Fix

## 🎯 **The Problem**
OAuth callbacks are failing silently because **Row Level Security (RLS)** policies are blocking users from inserting their own integration records.

## ✅ **The Solution**
Apply RLS policies that allow users to manage their own integrations while maintaining security.

---

## 🚀 **Step-by-Step Fix**

### 1. **Apply RLS Policy Fix**
Run this SQL in **Supabase SQL Editor**:

```sql
-- Fix RLS Policies for OAuth Integration Saves
-- This allows users to manage their own integrations while maintaining security

-- Drop existing policies if they exist
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can manage their own integrations" ON public.integrations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert their own integrations" ON public.integrations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own integrations" ON public.integrations;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their own integrations" ON public.integrations;

-- Create comprehensive RLS policies for integrations table
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own integrations"
ON public.integrations FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own integrations"
ON public.integrations FOR UPDATE
USING (auth.uid() = user_id)
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own integrations"
ON public.integrations FOR DELETE
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can select their own integrations"
ON public.integrations FOR SELECT
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Verify RLS is enabled
ALTER TABLE public.integrations ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Test the policies work
SELECT 'RLS policies created successfully!' as result;
```

### 2. **Hard Refresh Browser**
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (or `Cmd + Shift + R` on Mac)
- This clears any cached authentication state

### 3. **Test Gmail OAuth**
1. Go to: `http://localhost:5173/onboarding/email-integration`
2. Click **"Connect Gmail"**
3. Complete OAuth flow
4. **Watch browser console** for detailed messages

## 🔍 **What You'll See**

### ✅ **Success (After Fix)**
```
🔄 Attempting to save integration to database...
🔍 User ID for RLS check: fedf818f-986f-4b30-bfa1-7fc339c7bb60
🔍 Auth UID check: fedf818f-986f-4b30-bfa1-7fc339c7bb60
✅ Integration stored successfully!
📋 Inserted data: [object with integration data]
```

### ❌ **RLS Error (Before Fix)**
```
🔄 Attempting to save integration to database...
❌ Integration storage failed: [error details]
🚨 PERMISSION ERROR: RLS policy is blocking the insert
💡 This means the RLS policy needs to be updated to allow user inserts
```

---

## 🧪 **Verification**

After applying the fix, verify it worked:

### 1. **Check Database**
```sql
SELECT user_id, provider, status, created_at 
FROM public.integrations 
WHERE user_id = 'fedf818f-986f-4b30-bfa1-7fc339c7bb60';
```

### 2. **Check Policies**
```sql
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, permissive, roles, cmd, qual, with_check
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'integrations' 
ORDER BY policyname;
```

---

## 🎉 **Expected Outcome**

After applying the RLS fix:

1. **Gmail OAuth completes** → Returns valid tokens
2. **Integration data prepared** → User ID, provider, tokens, scopes, status: 'active'
3. **Database insert succeeds** → RLS policy allows user to insert their own record
4. **UI shows "Gmail Connected"** → Integration verified
5. **n8n workflow activates** → No more "Unable to sign without access token"

---

## 🔧 **Files Modified**

1. `fix-rls-policies.sql` - RLS policy fix (needs to be applied)
2. `src/contexts/SupabaseAuthContext.jsx` - Enhanced error logging (applied ✅)

---

## 🚀 **Ready to Test!**

The RLS policy fix will resolve the silent OAuth failure. Once applied, the OAuth flow should work end-to-end:

**OAuth → Database Save → Integration Verification → n8n Workflow Activation** ✅
