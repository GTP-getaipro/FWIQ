# User Guide: Manager Role-Based Email Classification

## Overview

Your FloWorx AI system can now intelligently route emails based on your team members' roles. When you set up managers during onboarding, the AI will recognize both their names and the types of work they handle.

## How to Set Up Manager Roles

### Step 1: Navigate to Team Setup

During onboarding, you'll reach the "Team Setup" step where you can add your managers and team members.

### Step 2: Add Manager Information

For each manager, provide:

1. **Name**: Full name of the manager
2. **Email**: Their email address (for forwarding)
3. **Roles**: Select one or more roles from:

   - **üí∞ Sales Manager**: Handles quotes, new leads, pricing inquiries
   - **üîß Service Manager**: Handles repairs, appointments, emergencies
   - **‚öôÔ∏è Operations Manager**: Handles vendors, internal ops, hiring
   - **üí¨ Support Lead**: Handles general questions, parts, how-to
   - **üëî Owner/CEO**: Handles strategic, legal, high-priority matters

4. **Email Forwarding**: Toggle on/off whether to forward emails to this manager

### Step 3: Example Configuration

**Example Company: "The Hot Tub Man Ltd."**

| Manager | Email | Roles | Forwarding |
|---------|-------|-------|------------|
| John Doe | john@hottubman.com | Sales Manager, Owner/CEO | ‚úÖ On |
| Jane Smith | jane@hottubman.com | Service Manager | ‚úÖ On |

3. Your AI system will now recognize your managers by name and role

## How Email Classification Works

### By Manager Name

When customers mention a manager by name, the AI recognizes them:

**Example 1:**
```
Subject: Question for John
Body: Hi John, can you send me a quote for installation?
```
‚û°Ô∏è **Result**: Categorized as **SALES** (John is Sales Manager)

**Example 2:**
```
Subject: For Jane - Emergency Repair
Body: Jane, our hot tub stopped working. Need urgent help!
```
‚û°Ô∏è **Result**: Categorized as **URGENT/SUPPORT** (Jane is Service Manager)

### By Role Keywords

Even without mentioning names, the AI understands what each role handles:

**Sales Manager Keywords:**
- price, quote, buy, purchase, how much, cost
- estimate, proposal, new customer, interested in

**Example:**
```
Subject: Pricing inquiry
Body: Can I get a quote for hot tub installation?
```
‚û°Ô∏è **Result**: Categorized as **SALES** (matches Sales Manager keywords)

**Service Manager Keywords:**
- repair, fix, broken, appointment, emergency
- service call, urgent, not working, maintenance

**Example:**
```
Subject: Hot tub not heating
Body: Our spa won't heat up and is showing error codes.
```
‚û°Ô∏è **Result**: Categorized as **SUPPORT/URGENT** (matches Service Manager keywords)

**Operations Manager Keywords:**
- vendor, supplier, hiring, internal operations
- procurement, inventory, partnership, contract

**Example:**
```
Subject: Supplier partnership opportunity
Body: We'd like to discuss supplying chemicals to your business.
```
‚û°Ô∏è **Result**: Categorized as **MANAGER/SUPPLIERS** (matches Operations keywords)
