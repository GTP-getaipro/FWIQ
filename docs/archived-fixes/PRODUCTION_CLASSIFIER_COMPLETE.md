## üéâ **Summary: Hot Tub Man Style Classifier for All 12 Business Types**

**Status:** ‚úÖ Core Implementation Complete  
**Coverage:** Production-style classifier built and integrated  
**Remaining:** Apply production enhancements to 11 remaining label schemas  

---

## üìä **What Was Implemented**

### **1. Enhanced Electrician Schema (Template)** ‚úÖ

**File:** `src/labelSchemas/electrician.json`

**New Features Added:**
- ‚úÖ Tertiary categories for BANKING (FromBusiness/ToBusiness, PaymentSent/PaymentReceived)
- ‚úÖ Special rules (FormSub Override, Phone Detection, Internal Email, Emergency Providers)
- ‚úÖ Auto-reply rules (confidence-based, category-based, domain-based)
- ‚úÖ Domain detection (suppliers, phone providers, internal domains)
- ‚úÖ Common labels section (FORMSUB, PHONE, GOOGLE REVIEW, MANAGER, etc.)

**Structure:**
```json
{
  "labels": [
    {
      "name": "URGENT",
      "sub": [
        {"name": "No Power", "keywords": [...]}
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "BANKING",
      "sub": [
        {

        },
        {
          "name": "receipts",
          "tertiary": [
            {"name": "PaymentSent", "keywords": ["you paid", "amount paid"]},
            {"name": "PaymentReceived", "keywords": ["payment received", "customer paid"]}
          ]
        }
      ]
    }

      "action": {"force_ai_can_reply": false}
    }
  ],
  
  "autoReplyRules": {
    "enabled": true,
    "minConfidence": 0.75,
    "enabledCategories": ["Support", "Sales", "Urgent"]
  },
  
  "domainDetection": {
    "suppliers": [{"name": "{{Supplier1}}", "domains": []}],
    "phoneProviders": [{"provider": "RingCentral", "email": "service@ringcentral.com"}],
    "internalDomains": ["@{{businessInfo.emailDomain}}"]
  }
}
```

### **2. Production Classifier Generator** ‚úÖ

**File:** `src/lib/aiSchemaInjector.js`

**New Function:**
```javascript
buildProductionClassifier(aiConfig, labelConfig, businessInfo, managers, suppliers)
```

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ Includes tertiary category support
- ‚úÖ Outputs special rules
- ‚úÖ Includes auto-reply logic
- ‚úÖ Manager name replacement
- ‚úÖ Supplier domain detection
- ‚úÖ 3-level hierarchy (primary ‚Üí secondary ‚Üí tertiary)

**Output Example:**
```
You are an expert email processing and routing system for "ABC Electric".

### Business Context:
- Business Name: ABC Electric
- Business Type(s): Electrician
- Email Domain: abcelectric.com
- Managers: John, Sarah, Mike
- Suppliers: Home Depot, Local Supply

### Auto-Reply Rules:
If the email is from an external sender, and primary_category is Support or Sales or Urgent, 
and confidence is at least 0.75, always set "ai_can_reply": true.
If the sender's email address ends with "@abcelectric.com", always set "ai_can_reply": false.

### Category Structure with Classification Keywords:

**URGENT [CRITICAL]** (ai.emergency_request):
Electrical emergencies requiring immediate attention
Keywords: urgent, emergency, ASAP, spark, shock, fire, no power, breaker, tripping...
Patterns: (no power) + (in|to) + (house|building) | breaker + (keeps) + (tripping)
secondary_category: [No Power, Electrical Hazard, Sparking/Smoking, Breaker Issues]
  ‚Ä¢ No Power: no power, power out, blackout, lost power
  ‚Ä¢ Electrical Hazard: spark, sparking, shock, shocked, hazard
  ‚Ä¢ Sparking/Smoking: spark, smoke, burning smell, fire
  ‚Ä¢ Breaker Issues: breaker, tripping, trips, won't stay on

**BANKING [CRITICAL]** (ai.financial_transaction):
Financial transactions, invoices, and payments
Keywords: invoice, payment, e-transfer, receipt, refund, interac...
secondary_category: [e-transfer, invoice, bank-alert, refund, receipts]
  ‚Ä¢ e-transfer: interac, e-transfer, you received, you sent
    Tertiary: [FromBusiness, ToBusiness]
      - FromBusiness: you sent, payment completed, transfer to
      - ToBusiness: you received, funds deposited, payment received
  ‚Ä¢ receipts: receipt, order confirmation, payment summary
    Tertiary: [PaymentSent, PaymentReceived]
      - PaymentSent: you paid, amount paid, charged your
      - PaymentReceived: payment received, customer paid

### Special Classification Rules:
1. **FormSub Urgent Override**: Form submissions with urgent keywords must be classified as URGENT
   Trigger keywords: broken, not working, leaking, won't start, no power, error code
   Action: {"override_primary":"URGENT","reason":"Form contains emergency electrical issue"}

2. **Internal Email Detection**: Never auto-reply to internal company emails
   Action: {"force_ai_can_reply":false,"route_to":"MANAGER"}

### JSON Output Format:
{
  "primary_category": "URGENT",
  "secondary_category": "Breaker Issues",
  "tertiary_category": null,
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "ai_can_reply": true
}
```

---

### **3. Template Service Integration** ‚úÖ

**File:** `src/lib/templateService.js`

**Changes:**
- ‚úÖ Imported `buildProductionClassifier`
- ‚úÖ Updated to use production classifier by default
- ‚úÖ Passes managers and suppliers to classifier
- ‚úÖ Fallback to label-aware message if production fails

**Code:**
```javascript
const productionClassifier = buildProductionClassifier(
  aiConfig, 
  labelConfig, 
  businessInfo,
  clientData.managers || [],
  clientData.suppliers || []
);
aiPlaceholders['<<<AI_SYSTEM_MESSAGE>>>'] = productionClassifier;
console.log('‚úÖ Production-style classifier generated');
```

---

## üéØ **What Makes This "Hot Tub Man" Style**

### **1. 3-Level Hierarchy**
```
Primary: BANKING
  ‚Üì
Secondary: e-transfer
  ‚Üì
Tertiary: ToBusiness
```

**Example:**
- Email: "You received an e-Transfer from John Smith - $500"
- Classification: BANKING ‚Üí e-transfer ‚Üí ToBusiness
- Confidence: 0.96
- ai_can_reply: false (banking emails need human review)

---

### **2. Special Classification Rules**

**FormSub Urgent Override:**
```
Email: Website form with "My heater is broken and won't start"
Normal: FORMSUB/NewSubmission
Override: URGENT (because contains "broken" + "won't start")
Result: Routed to URGENT for immediate attention ‚úÖ
```

**Internal Email Detection:**
```
Email from: john@abcelectric.com
Rule: sender_domain = @abcelectric.com
Action: force_ai_can_reply = false, route to MANAGER
Result: Never auto-responds to internal emails ‚úÖ
```

**Phone Provider Detection:**
```
Email from: service@ringcentral.com
Rule: sender_email_exact = service@ringcentral.com
Action: force_primary = PHONE
Result: Always routes RingCentral to PHONE folder ‚úÖ
```

---

### **3. Auto-Reply Logic**

**Conditions:**
```javascript
ai_can_reply = true IF:
  1. primary_category in [Support, Sales, Urgent]
  AND
  2. confidence >= 0.75
  AND
  3. sender NOT @businessdomain.com
  
OTHERWISE ai_can_reply = false
```

**Examples:**
| Email Type | Category | Confidence | Internal? | ai_can_reply |
|------------|----------|------------|-----------|--------------|
| "Breaker tripping" | URGENT | 0.95 | No | ‚úÖ true |
| "How much to install EV charger?" | SALES | 0.88 | No | ‚úÖ true |
| "Invoice received" | BANKING | 0.92 | No | ‚ùå false (Banking) |
| "John to Sarah: meeting?" | MANAGER | 0.85 | Yes | ‚ùå false (Internal) |
| "Customer question" | SUPPORT | 0.65 | No | ‚ùå false (Low confidence) |

---

### **4. Domain Detection**

**Supplier Detection:**
```json
"domainDetection": {
  "suppliers": [
    {
      "name": "Home Depot",
      "domains": ["@homedepot.com", "@homedepot.ca"],
      "route_to": "SUPPLIERS/Home Depot"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Example:**
- Email from: orders@homedepot.com
- Auto-detect: Matches supplier domain
- Route: SUPPLIERS/Home Depot
- ai_can_reply: false

---

## üìã **Remaining Work**

### **To Match Hot Tub Man 100%:**

**11 Schemas Need Production Enhancements:**
1. ‚è≥ plumber.json - Add common labels, special rules, auto-reply
2. ‚è≥ pools_spas.json - Add tertiary categories, special rules
3. ‚è≥ hot_tub_spa.json - Add production sections
4. ‚è≥ hvac.json - Add production sections
5. ‚è≥ general_contractor.json - Add production sections
6. ‚è≥ flooring_contractor.json - Add production sections
7. ‚è≥ landscaping.json - Add production sections
8. ‚è≥ painting_contractor.json - Add production sections
9. ‚è≥ roofing.json - Add production sections
10. ‚è≥ sauna_icebath.json - Add production sections
11. ‚è≥ insulation_foam_spray.json - Add production sections

**What to Add to Each:**
- commonLabels section (FORMSUB, PHONE, MANAGER, etc.)
- specialRules section (FormSub override, phone detection, internal email)
- autoReplyRules section (confidence-based auto-reply)
- domainDetection section (supplier/phone provider matching)
- Tertiary categories for BANKING label

---

## üöÄ **How to Apply Template**

### **Template Pattern (Copy to Each Schema):**

```json
{
  "labels": [
    // ... existing industry-specific labels with keywords ...
  ],
  
  "commonLabels": [
    // Copy from _production_common_sections.json
  ],
  
  "specialRules": [
    {
      "name": "FormSub Urgent Override",
      "trigger": {"keywords_in_body": ["broken", "not working", "emergency", "leak", "no power"]},
      "action": {"override_primary": "URGENT"}
    },
    {
      "name": "Phone Provider Detection",
      "trigger": {"sender_email_exact": ["service@ringcentral.com"]},
      "action": {"force_primary": "PHONE"}
    },
    {
      "name": "Internal Email Detection",
      "trigger": {"sender_domain": "@{{businessInfo.emailDomain}}"},
      "action": {"force_ai_can_reply": false, "route_to": "MANAGER"}
    }
  ],
  
  "autoReplyRules": {
    "enabled": true,
    "minConfidence": 0.75,
    "enabledCategories": ["Support", "Sales", "Urgent"]
  },
  
  "domainDetection": {
    "suppliers": [],
    "phoneProviders": [{"provider": "RingCentral", "email": "service@ringcentral.com"}],
    "internalDomains": ["@{{businessInfo.emailDomain}}"]
  }
}
```

## üéØ **Current Status**

### **‚úÖ Complete:**
1. ‚úÖ Electrician schema - Full production style
2. ‚úÖ Production classifier function - `buildProductionClassifier()`
3. ‚úÖ Template service integration - Uses production classifier
4. ‚úÖ Common sections template - `_production_common_sections.json`

### **‚è≥ Remaining:**
1. ‚è≥ Apply production template to 11 remaining schemas
2. ‚è≥ Add business-specific tertiary categories
3. ‚è≥ Add business-specific special rules

---

## üìà **Expected Improvements**

### **Classification Hierarchy:**

**Before (2-level):**
```
BANKING ‚Üí invoice
```

**After (3-level):**
```
BANKING ‚Üí e-transfer ‚Üí ToBusiness
BANKING ‚Üí receipts ‚Üí PaymentReceived
```

**Benefit:** Precise financial tracking and categorization

---

### **Special Rules:**

**FormSub Override:**
```
Before: All forms ‚Üí FORMSUB
After: Forms with "broken" ‚Üí URGENT
Benefit: Emergency forms get immediate attention
```

**Phone Detection:**
```
Before: Generic phone classification
After: Only service@ringcentral.com ‚Üí PHONE
Benefit: No false positives
```

**Internal Email:**
```
Before: May auto-reply to internal emails
After: @businessdomain.com ‚Üí no auto-reply
Benefit: Never responds to internal communications
```

---

### **Auto-Reply Accuracy:**

**Before:**
```
All emails might get auto-reply (risky!)
```

**After:**
```
Auto-reply ONLY if:
- Category: Support/Sales/Urgent
- Confidence: ‚â• 0.75
- NOT internal email
```

**Benefit:** Safe, confidence-based auto-replies

---

## üéØ **Production-Ready Features**

### **1. Tertiary Categories**

**Banking:**
- e-transfer ‚Üí FromBusiness (you sent payment)
- e-transfer ‚Üí ToBusiness (you received payment)
- receipts ‚Üí PaymentSent (you paid vendor)
- receipts ‚Üí PaymentReceived (customer paid you)

**Use Cases:**
- Accounting: Track outgoing vs incoming payments
- Reporting: Separate vendor payments from customer receipts
- Reconciliation: Match payments to invoices

---

### **2. Special Rules Engine**

**Rules:**
1. FormSub Urgent Override (critical)
2. Phone Provider Detection (high)
3. Internal Email Detection (critical)
4. Service Platform Alerts (high)
5. Work Order Completion (medium)

**Priority Levels:**
- Critical: Must execute first
- High: Execute before normal classification
- Medium: Execute during classification

---

### **3. Domain Detection**

**Supplier Auto-Routing:**
```
Email from @homedepot.com ‚Üí SUPPLIERS/Home Depot
Email from @supplierco.com ‚Üí SUPPLIERS/{{Supplier1}}
```

**Phone Provider:**
```
Email from service@ringcentral.com ‚Üí PHONE
```

**Internal:**
```
Email from @abcelectric.com ‚Üí MANAGER (no auto-reply)
```

---

## üöÄ **Next Steps to Complete**

### **Batch Process Remaining Schemas:**

**Script Approach:**
1. Read `_production_common_sections.json`
2. For each of 11 remaining schemas:
   - Add `commonLabels` section
   - Add `specialRules` section  
   - Add `autoReplyRules` section
   - Add `domainDetection` section
   - Enhance BANKING with tertiary categories
3. Validate JSON
4. Test classifier output

**Estimated Time:** 30-45 minutes for all 11 schemas

---

## üìä **Comparison: Before vs After**

### **Before (Basic Keywords):**
```
Email: "You received an e-Transfer from customer"
Classification:
  primary_category: BANKING
  secondary_category: null
  tertiary_category: null
  confidence: 0.70

Route: BANKING folder (generic)
```

### **After (Production Style):**
```
Email: "You received an e-Transfer from customer"
Classification:
  primary_category: BANKING
  secondary_category: e-transfer
  tertiary_category: ToBusiness
  confidence: 0.95
  matched_keywords: ["you received", "e-transfer", "funds deposited"]

Route: BANKING/e-Transfer/To Business folder (specific)
AI can reply: false (banking needs human review)
```

**Improvement:**
- More specific routing (3 levels vs 1)
- Higher confidence (0.95 vs 0.70)
- Matched keywords tracked
- Auto-reply logic applied
