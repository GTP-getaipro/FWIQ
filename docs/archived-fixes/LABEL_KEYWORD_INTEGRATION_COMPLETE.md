2. ✅ **Built Label-Aware System Message Generator**
3. ✅ **Integrated into Deployment Flow**

---

## 📊 **What Was Implemented**

### **1. Enhanced Label Schemas (HIGH Priority)** ✅

**Files Updated:**
- ✅ `src/labelSchemas/electrician.json` - Complete with keywords, patterns, examples
- ✅ `src/labelSchemas/pools_spas.json` - URGENT and SEASONAL enhanced

**New Schema Structure:**

```json
{
  "name": "URGENT",
  "intent": "ai.emergency_request",
  "critical": true,
  "description": "Electrical emergencies requiring immediate attention",
  
  "classificationRules": {
    "keywords": {
      "primary": ["urgent", "emergency", "ASAP"],
      "electrical": ["spark", "shock", "fire", "smoke"],
      "power": ["no power", "power out", "blackout"],
      "safety": ["hazard", "danger", "unsafe"],
      "equipment": ["breaker", "tripping", "panel", "not working"]
    },
    
    "patterns": [
      "(no power|power out) + (in|to) + (house|building)",
      "(spark|sparking) + from + (outlet|panel|wire)",
      "breaker + (keeps|won't) + (tripping|stay on)"
    ],
    
    "examples": [
      "URGENT: Sparking outlet in kitchen!",
      "No power in half the house",
      "Breaker keeps tripping every few minutes"
    ]
  },
  
  "sub": [
    {
      "name": "No Power",
      "description": "Complete power loss or outage",
      "keywords": ["no power", "power out", "blackout", "lost power"],
      "patterns": ["no power + in + (house|building|room)"],
      "examples": [
        "No power in half the house",
        "Power outage affecting my office"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Impact:** AI now has specific keywords and patterns for each label and subfolder!

---

### **2. Label-Aware System Message Generator (HIGH Priority)** ✅

**File:** `src/lib/aiSchemaInjector.js`

**New Function Added:**

```javascript
export const buildLabelAwareSystemMessage = (aiConfig, labelConfig, businessInfo) => {
  // Combines Layer 1 (AI schemas) + Layer 3 (Label schemas)
  // Generates comprehensive system message with:
  // - Label-specific keywords
  // - Classification patterns
  // - Real examples
  // - Subfolder routing instructions
  
  return enhancedSystemMessage;
};
```

**Sample Output:**

```
You are an expert email classifier for ABC Electric.

BUSINESS CONTEXT:
- Business: ABC Electric
- Types: Electrician

=== LABELS AND CLASSIFICATION RULES ===
Use these labels and their specific keywords to route emails accurately:

📁 URGENT [CRITICAL] (ai.emergency_request):
   Description: Electrical emergencies requiring immediate attention
   Keywords:
   • primary: urgent, emergency, ASAP, immediately, critical, help
   • electrical: spark, sparking, shock, shocked, fire, smoke, burning
   • power: no power, power out, power outage, blackout, lost power
   Patterns: (no power|power out) + (in|to) + (house|building) | (spark|sparking) + from + (outlet|panel)
   Examples:
   - "URGENT: Sparking outlet in kitchen!"
   - "No power in half the house since this morning"
   - "Breaker keeps tripping every few minutes"
   Subfolders:
   └─ No Power: no power, power out, power outage, blackout
   └─ Electrical Hazard: spark, sparking, shock, shocked, hazard
   └─ Sparking/Smoking: spark, sparking, smoke, smoking, burning smell
   └─ Breaker Issues: breaker, tripping, trips, won't stay on

📁 PERMITS (ai.permit_inquiry):
   Description: Electrical permits, inspections, and code compliance
   Keywords:
   • primary: permit, permits, permitting, inspection, inspector
   • regulatory: ESA, electrical code, building code, NEC, CEC
   Patterns: (permit|permits) + (for|required|needed) | (inspection|inspector) + (scheduled|coming)
   Examples:
   - "Do I need a permit for panel upgrade?"
   - "When will the electrical inspection happen?"

=== CLASSIFICATION INSTRUCTIONS ===
1. Match email content against label keywords and patterns above
2. Consider urgency: CRITICAL labels take priority for safety/emergencies
3. Use most specific subfolder when keywords match
4. Return JSON with:
   - primary_category: Main label name (e.g., "URGENT", "SALES")
   - secondary_category: Subfolder name if applicable (e.g., "No Power")
   - confidence: 0.0 to 1.0 (how confident you are)
   - matched_keywords: Array of keywords that triggered classification
   - reasoning: Brief explanation of why this classification
```

**Impact:** AI receives precise, business-specific routing instructions!

### **3. Template Service Integration (MEDIUM Priority)** ✅

**File:** `src/lib/templateService.js`

**Changes Made:**

```javascript
// Added imports
import { 
  extractAIConfigForN8n, 
  generateAIPlaceholders, 
  buildLabelAwareSystemMessage,  // NEW!
  loadLabelSchemaForBusinessTypes  // NEW!
} from '@/lib/aiSchemaInjector.js';

// Enhanced AI config extraction
try {
  // Step 1: Extract AI config from Layer 1
  aiConfig = extractAIConfigForN8n(businessTypes, businessInfo);
  
  // Step 2: Load Label config from Layer 3 (NEW!)
  labelConfig = await loadLabelSchemaForBusinessTypes(businessTypes);
  console.log('✅ Label schema loaded from Layer 3');
  
  // Step 3: Build LABEL-AWARE system message (NEW!)
  if (labelConfig && labelConfig.labels.length > 0) {
    const labelAwareSystemMessage = buildLabelAwareSystemMessage(
      aiConfig, 
      labelConfig, 
      businessInfo
    );
    aiPlaceholders['<<<AI_SYSTEM_MESSAGE>>>'] = labelAwareSystemMessage;
    console.log('✅ Label-aware AI system message generated with classification keywords');
  }
  
  console.log('✅ AI config extracted from Layer 1 + Layer 3 (businessSchemas + labelSchemas)');
} catch (error) {
  // Fallback to defaults
}
```

**Impact:** Every N8N workflow deployment now includes label-specific keywords!

## 🔄 **Complete Flow (Before vs After)**

### **Before (Generic Classification):**

```
1. Email arrives: "My breaker keeps tripping and sparking"

2. AI Classifier receives generic prompt:
   "You are an email classifier for ABC Electric.
    Classify emails into categories: URGENT, SALES, SUPPORT, BANKING."

3. AI Classification:
   - Sees "tripping" and "sparking"
   - Guesses it's urgent (confidence: 0.65)
   - No subfolder guidance
   
4. Result:
   Primary: URGENT
   Subfolder: None
   Confidence: 0.65
   
❌ Imprecise, no subfolder routing
```

---

### **After (Label-Aware Classification):**

```
1. Email arrives: "My breaker keeps tripping and sparking"

2. AI Classifier receives enhanced prompt with keywords:
   "📁 URGENT [CRITICAL]:
    Keywords: spark, shock, breaker, tripping, no power
    Patterns: 'breaker + (keeps|won't) + tripping'
    
    Subfolders:
    └─ Breaker Issues: breaker, tripping, trips, won't stay on
    └─ Electrical Hazard: spark, sparking, shock"

3. AI Classification:
   - Matches "breaker" + "tripping" pattern
   - Matches "sparking" from Electrical Hazard keywords
   - High confidence due to specific matches
   
4. Result:
   Primary: URGENT
   Subfolder: Breaker Issues
   Confidence: 0.95
   Matched Keywords: ["breaker", "tripping", "sparking"]
   Reasoning: "Email contains breaker tripping pattern and sparking keyword"
   
✅ Precise, subfolder routing, high confidence!
