## üöÄ **Integration Steps**

### **Step 1: Edge Function Integration** (Next)

The generator is ready but needs to be integrated into the edge function. Since the edge function runs in Deno, we need to:

1. **Copy the template logic** into the edge function (inline)
2. **Replace `generateDynamicAISystemMessage`** with new generator
3. **Test with real deployment**

**Files to modify**:
- `supabase/functions/deploy-n8n/index.ts` (lines 55-400)

**Changes needed**:
```typescript
// BEFORE:
const aiSystemMessage = await generateDynamicAISystemMessage(userId);

// AFTER:
const aiSystemMessage = generateComprehensiveSystemMessage({
  business_type: profile.business_types?.[0] || profile.business_type,
  business_types: profile.business_types,
  client_config: profile.client_config,
  managers: profile.managers,
  suppliers: profile.suppliers
}, voiceProfile);
```

---

### **Step 2: Frontend Integration** (Optional)

The generator can also be used in the frontend for preview:

```javascript
import { generateComprehensiveSystemMessage } from '@/lib/comprehensiveSystemMessageGenerator';

// In onboarding preview
const systemMessage = generateComprehensiveSystemMessage(profileData, voiceProfile);
```
