# ✅ App Restarted - Ready to Test!

## 🎯 What's Different Now:

### ✅ **Production Template Active**
- Your app now uses `public/templates/gmail-workflow-template.json`
- 17 nodes with complete AI classification + reply generation
- Voice training integration
- Performance metrics tracking
- AI learning system

### ✅ **Files Updated:**
1. `src/lib/templateService.js` - Dynamic template loading with caching
2. `src/lib/workflowDeployer.js` - Async template loading
3. `public/templates/gmail-workflow-template.json` - Production template

### ✅ **Credentials Configured:**
- Supabase: `mQziputTJekSuLa6` (hardcoded in template)
- OpenAI: `<<<CLIENT_OPENAI_CRED_ID>>>` (dynamic per user)
- Gmail: `<<<CLIENT_GMAIL_CRED_ID>>>` (dynamic per user)

## 🧪 Test Steps:

### 1. Open Your App
```
http://localhost:5173/onboarding/deploy
```

### 2. Click "Save and Continue"

### 3. Watch Console - You Should See:
```
✅ Production Gmail template loaded: { nodes: 17, version: "2.0" }
🏗️ Step 2: Loading production-ready template...
✅ Production template loaded (works for all business types)
💉 Step 3: Preparing data for template injection...
🔧 Step 4: Injecting data into template...
✅ Template injection complete
🚀 Step 5: Deploying injected workflow to n8n...
✅ Backend API deployment successful: [workflow-id]
```

### 4. If You See Duplicate Error:

**The workflow IS in N8N!** Just fix the database:

```sql
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:
DELETE FROM workflows WHERE n8n_workflow_id = 'jnr4LMPcdElrLLZ8';
```

Then deploy again - it will create a fresh workflow.

---

## 🎯 Expected Results:

### ✅ Success Indicators:
- Console shows "Production template loaded"
- Deployment completes without errors
- Workflow ID returned (e.g., `xyz123`)
- N8N shows active workflow
- Database record created

### 🔍 Verify in N8N:
1. Go to https://n8n.srv995290.hstgr.cloud
2. Look for your workflow (named like `business-name-xxxxx-workflow`)
3. Check it's **Active** (green toggle)
4. Click workflow to see all 17 nodes
5. Verify credentials are set on all nodes

---

## 📧 Test Live Email Processing:

### After Successful Deployment:

1. **Send a test email** to your connected Gmail account
2. **Wait 2-3 minutes** (workflow polls every 2 minutes)
3. **Check N8N Executions tab** - You should see:
   - Execution started
   - All nodes executed
   - Labels applied
   - (If eligible) Draft created

### What the Workflow Does:

```
📧 New Email Arrives
  ↓
🤖 AI Classifies (GPT-4o-mini)
  ↓
🏷️ Gmail Label Applied
  ↓
❓ Can AI Reply?
  ↓ (if yes)
🎤 Fetch Voice Profile
  ↓
✍️ AI Generates Draft (Voice-trained)
  ↓
📝 Save Draft + Learning Data
  ↓
📊 Save Performance Metrics
```

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting:

### "Template not found"
**Check**: `http://localhost:5173/templates/gmail-workflow-template.json` loads in browser

### "Workflow deployed but duplicate error"
**Fix**: Run the DELETE SQL above, then deploy again

### "No executions showing in N8N"
**Check**: 
1. Workflow is Active in N8N
2. Gmail credentials are valid
3. Test email is in inbox (not spam/promotions)
4. Wait full 2 minutes for poll

---

## 📈 Monitoring After Deployment:

### Check Performance Metrics:
```sql
SELECT * FROM performance_metrics 
WHERE client_id = 'your-user-id'
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;
```

### Check AI Learning Data:
```sql
SELECT * FROM ai_draft_learning
WHERE user_id = 'your-user-id'
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;
```

### Check Workflow Errors:
```sql
SELECT * FROM workflow_errors
WHERE user_id = 'your-user-id'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```
