## üîÑ **How Voice Analysis Handles Multi-Business**

### **Email Categorization** (Works for Multiple Business Types):

```javascript
// Universal keywords apply to ANY combination:

const keywords = {
  support: [
    'repair', 'fix', 'troubleshoot', 'service',  ‚Üê Works for electrical repairs
    'not working', 'broken', 'maintenance'       ‚Üê Works for plumbing repairs
  ],
  sales: [
    'quote', 'estimate', 'price', 'installation', ‚Üê Works for both businesses
    'new', 'replacement', 'upgrade'
  ],
  urgent: [
    'emergency', 'asap', 'urgent', 'critical',
    'no power', 'flooding', 'leaking', 'dangerous' ‚Üê Covers both businesses
  ]
};

// Categorization works regardless of business type combination!
```

### **Few-Shot Example Distribution**:

```javascript
// 50 sent emails from multi-business client:
sentEmails = [
  {subject: "Panel upgrade", ...},           // Electrician
  {subject: "Water heater repair", ...},     // Plumber
  {subject: "Outlet installation", ...},     // Electrician
  {subject: "Drain cleaning", ...},          // Plumber
  // ... 46 more emails
];

// Categorized by INTENT, not by business type:
categorized = {
  support: [
    "Panel upgrade",         // Electrician support
    "Water heater repair",   // Plumber support
    "Outlet installation",   // Electrician support
    "Drain cleaning"         // Plumber support
  ],
  sales: [...],  // Mix of both

## üéØ **Key Features for Multi-Business**

### **1. Schema Merging** (Already Implemented):
```javascript
// src/lib/aiSchemaMerger.js
mergeAIBusinessSchemas(["Electrician", "Plumber"])
  ‚Üí Combines keywords from BOTH schemas
  ‚Üí Deduplicates overlapping keywords
  ‚Üí Creates unified classification rules

// src/lib/behaviorSchemaMerger.js
mergeBusinessTypeBehaviors(["Electrician", "Plumber"])
  ‚Üí Blends tones from BOTH schemas
  ‚Üí Combines behavior goals
  ‚Üí Merges category-specific language
```

### **2. Voice Profile** (Universal - Works for Multi-Business):
```javascript
// Voice profile captures client's style across ALL their services
voiceProfile = {
  tone: "Professional, safety-focused",
  fewShotExamples: {
    support: [
      // Naturally includes examples from ALL business types
      {subject: "Re: No power", ...},           // Electrician
      {subject: "Re: Pipe leak", ...},          // Plumber
      {subject: "Re: Water heater", ...}        // Plumber
    ]
  }
};

// AI uses appropriate example based on email context:
// - Electrical inquiry ‚Üí Uses electrical example
// - Plumbing inquiry ‚Üí Uses plumbing example
```

### **3. Template Injection** (Multi-Business Aware):
```javascript
// src/lib/templateService.js

// Line 107: Handles array of business types
const businessTypes = Array.isArray(businessType) ? businessType : [businessType];

// Line 133: Passes array to AI schema extraction
aiConfig = extractAIConfigForN8n(businessTypes, businessInfo);

// Line 151: Passes array to behavior schema extraction
behaviorConfig = extractBehaviorConfigForN8n(businessTypes, businessInfo, voiceProfile);

// Result: Template works for 1, 2, 3, or MORE business types!
```
