## 🎯 **How It Works in Practice**

### **Example: Support Email**

**Incoming Email**:
```
From: customer@example.com
Subject: Hot tub jets not working
Body: Hi, my hot tub jets suddenly stopped working. What should I do?
```

**AI Draft (WITH few-shot examples)**:
```
Hi [Customer Name],

That definitely sounds frustrating — we know how disappointing it can be when 
your spa isn't working the way it should. Here's what I'd recommend checking first:

1. Check your filter - a clogged filter can reduce water flow
2. Verify the valves are fully open
3. Make sure the water level is adequate

If those don't help, we'd be happy to schedule a service call. You can book here:
https://www.thehottubman.ca/repairs

If you need any filters, chemicals, or test strips, let us know — we can have 
the tech bring those out with them!

Thanks so much for supporting our small business!
Best regards,
The Hot Tub Man Team

```

  jsonb_object_keys(style_profile->'fewShotExamples') as example_categories,
  learning_count,
  last_updated
FROM communication_styles
WHERE user_id = 'your-user-id';
```

### **Test 3: Check Few-Shot Examples**
```sql
-- Extract few-shot examples
