# ✅ Voice Training Implementation Complete!

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

### **Feature: Automatic Email Voice Analysis During Onboarding**

After selecting their business type, the system now automatically:
1. ✅ **Scrapes 50 sent emails** from user's Gmail/Outlook
2. ✅ **Categorizes emails** by intent (support, sales, urgent, follow-up, general)
3. ✅ **Extracts few-shot examples** (3 per category) 
4. ✅ **Analyzes writing style** using GPT-4o-mini
5. ✅ **Stores voice profile** in `communication_styles` table
6. ✅ **Uses profile in AI drafts** (automatically injected by edge function)

---

## 📁 Files Modified

### **1. src/pages/onboarding/Step3BusinessType.jsx**
**Changes:**
- ✅ Added import: `import { emailVoiceAnalyzer } from '@/lib/emailVoiceAnalyzer';`
- ✅ Added state: `const [isAnalyzingVoice, setIsAnalyzingVoice] = useState(false);`
- ✅ Added `triggerVoiceAnalysis()` function (lines 313-362)
- ✅ Added voice analysis call in `handleContinue()` (lines 296-298)
- ✅ Added loading indicator UI (lines 427-443)

**What It Does:**
- Triggers voice analysis **after** user clicks "Save & Continue"
- Runs in **background** (non-blocking - user navigates immediately)
- Shows **toast notifications** for progress and results
- Shows **floating indicator** while analysis runs
- Gracefully **falls back** to default profile if fails

## 🎤 How It Works

### **User Flow:**
```
1. User selects business type (e.g., "Electrician")
   ↓
2. User clicks "Save & Continue"
   ↓
3. System saves business type to database
   ↓
4. 🎤 System triggers voice analysis (background)
   ↓
5. User navigates to Team Setup (doesn't wait)
   ↓
6. Voice analysis fetches 50 sent emails
   ↓
7. AI analyzes writing style (15-30 sec)
   ↓
8. Results stored in `communication_styles` table
   ↓
9. Toast notification shows success
   ↓
10. Profile used in workflow deployment
```

### **Background Process:**
```javascript
// In Step3BusinessType.jsx (line 297-298)
console.log('🎤 Starting voice analysis in background...');
triggerVoiceAnalysis(user.id, selectedTypes[0]);

// triggerVoiceAnalysis function (lines 317-361)
const analysis = await emailVoiceAnalyzer.analyzeEmailVoice(userId, businessType);

// emailVoiceAnalyzer.js handles:
1. Fetch sent emails from Gmail/Outlook API
2. Categorize by intent
3. Extract few-shot examples
4. Call /api/ai/analyze-email-voice
5. Store in communication_styles table
```

## 🎯 How It's Used in AI Drafts

### **Edge Function Integration** (`supabase/functions/deploy-n8n/index.ts`)

```typescript
// Line 1066: Fetch voice profile
const { data: voiceData } = await supabaseAdmin
  .from('communication_styles')
  .select('style_profile, learning_count, last_updated')
  .eq('user_id', userId)
  .maybeSingle();

const voiceProfile = voiceData || null;

// Lines 1162-1200: Inject into behavior prompt
if (clientData.voiceProfile?.style_profile) {
  const voice = clientData.voiceProfile.style_profile.voice || {};
  const signaturePhrases = clientData.voiceProfile.style_profile.signaturePhrases || [];
  const learningCount = clientData.voiceProfile.learning_count || 0;
  
  behaviorReplyPrompt += `
🎤 LEARNED VOICE PROFILE (from ${learningCount} analyzed emails):
- Empathy Level: ${voice.empathyLevel}/1.0
- Formality Level: ${voice.formalityLevel}/1.0
- Directness Level: ${voice.directnessLevel}/1.0

YOUR PREFERRED PHRASES (use these frequently):
${signaturePhrases.map(p => `- "${p.phrase}"`).join('\\n')}

IMPORTANT: Match the style of YOUR learned voice profile.
  `;
}
```
