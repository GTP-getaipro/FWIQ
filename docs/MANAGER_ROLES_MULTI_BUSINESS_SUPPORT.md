# Manager Roles - Multi-Business Type Support

## ‚úÖ Confirmed: Fully Business-Agnostic

The manager role classification system is **designed to work with ALL business types** supported by FloWorx. The implementation is completely generic and integrates seamlessly with your existing dynamic label/system message generation.

## üè¢ Supported Business Types

The system works with ALL 12+ business types:

| Business Type | Manager Roles Work? | Label Generation | System Message |
|---------------|---------------------|------------------|----------------|
| **Electrician** | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Dynamic | ‚úÖ Business-specific |
| **Flooring** | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Dynamic | ‚úÖ Business-specific |
| **General Construction** | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Dynamic | ‚úÖ Business-specific |
| **HVAC** | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Dynamic | ‚úÖ Business-specific |
| **Insulation & Foam Spray** | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Dynamic | ‚úÖ Business-specific |

## üîß How It Works

### 1. Generic Manager Roles

The AVAILABLE_ROLES are **business-agnostic** and apply universally:

```javascript
export const AVAILABLE_ROLES = [
  {
    id: 'sales_manager',
    label: 'Sales Manager',
    description: 'Handles quotes, new leads, pricing inquiries',
    routes: ['SALES'],
    keywords: ['price', 'quote', 'buy', 'purchase', 'how much', 'cost']
  },
  {
    id: 'service_manager',
    label: 'Service Manager',
    description: 'Handles repairs, appointments, emergencies',
    routes: ['SUPPORT', 'URGENT'],
    keywords: ['repair', 'fix', 'broken', 'appointment', 'emergency']
  },
  // ... other generic roles
];
```

**Why this works for all businesses:**
- Sales Manager ‚Üí relevant for ALL businesses (everyone needs sales)
- Service Manager ‚Üí relevant for ALL service businesses
- Operations Manager ‚Üí relevant for vendor/supplier management
- Support Lead ‚Üí relevant for customer support
- Owner/CEO ‚Üí relevant for strategic/urgent matters

---

### 2. Integration with Business-Specific Labels

The system **preserves your existing label generation**:

```javascript
// Step 1: Generate business-specific labels (existing system)
const labelConfig = await loadLabelSchemaForBusinessTypes(businessTypes);
// Example for HVAC: HVAC-specific categories, keywords, rules

// Step 2: Build classifier with business context (existing system)
const businessInfo = {
  name: 'ACME HVAC Services',
  businessTypes: ['HVAC'],
  // ... other info
};

// Step 3: Add manager info (NEW - business-agnostic)
const managers = [
  { name: 'John', roles: ['sales_manager'] },
  { name: 'Jane', roles: ['service_manager'] }
];

// Step 4: Generate complete system message
const systemMessage = buildProductionClassifier(
  aiConfig,
  labelConfig,        // ‚Üê HVAC-specific labels
  businessInfo,       // ‚Üê HVAC-specific context
  managers,           // ‚Üê Generic manager roles
  suppliers
);
```

**Result:** System message contains:
- ‚úÖ HVAC-specific categories and keywords
- ‚úÖ HVAC-specific tertiary categories
- ‚úÖ Manager info with generic role descriptions
- ‚úÖ Business-specific rules and examples

---

### 3. EnhancedDynamicClassifierGenerator

The `EnhancedDynamicClassifierGenerator` already handles **business-specific customizations**:

```javascript
export class EnhancedDynamicClassifierGenerator {
  constructor(businessType, businessInfo, managers, suppliers, actualLabels, departmentScope) {
    this.businessType = businessType;  // ‚Üê 'HVAC', 'Plumber', etc.
    this.businessInfo = businessInfo;
    this.managers = managers;
    // ...
  }
  
  generateClassifierSystemMessage() {
    const categoryStructure = this.generateCategoryStructure();  // ‚Üê Business-specific
    const businessRules = this.generateBusinessRules();          // ‚Üê Business-specific
    const tertiaryRules = this.generateTertiaryRules();          // ‚Üê Business-specific
    const managerInfo = this.generateManagerInfo();              // ‚Üê Generic (NEW)
    const supplierInfo = this.generateSupplierInfo();            // ‚Üê Generic (NEW)
    
    // Combines business-specific + manager info
    return `...${categoryStructure}...${managerInfo}...`;
  }
}
```

**Key Point:** Manager info is **added to** business-specific content, not replacing it.

## üîÑ Integration Points

### Point 1: Label Schema Loading (Unchanged)

```javascript
// Existing system - works for all business types
const labelConfig = await loadLabelSchemaForBusinessTypes(businessTypes, managers, suppliers);
// Returns business-specific labels for HVAC, Plumber, etc.
```

### Point 2: System Message Building (Enhanced)

```javascript
// Enhanced with manager info (NEW parameter)
const systemMessage = buildProductionClassifier(
  aiConfig,           // Business-specific AI config
  labelConfig,        // Business-specific labels
  businessInfo,       // Business details
  managers,           // ‚Üê NEW: Manager info
  suppliers,          // ‚Üê NEW: Supplier info
  actualLabels,
  departmentScope     // ‚Üê NEW: Department filtering
);
```

### Point 3: Workflow Deployment (Enhanced)

```javascript
// In deploy-n8n Edge Function
const managers = profile.managers || [];
const suppliers = profile.suppliers || [];
const businessTypes = profile.business_types || [];

// Generate business-specific system message WITH manager info
const aiSystemMessage = await generateDynamicAISystemMessage(userId);
// ‚Üë Now includes manager section dynamically
```

## üéØ Key Design Principles

### 1. **Business-Agnostic Roles**
Manager roles (Sales, Service, Operations, Support, Owner) are universal concepts that apply to ALL businesses.

### 2. **Business-Specific Context**
The categories, keywords, and examples remain business-specific (e.g., "AC not cooling" for HVAC vs "leak" for Plumber).

### 3. **Additive, Not Replacement**
Manager info is **added to** the system message, not replacing business-specific content.

### 4. **Separation of Concerns**
- **Business Type** ‚Üí Determines categories, keywords, label structure
- **Manager Roles** ‚Üí Determines routing and team structure
- **Department Scope** ‚Üí Filters both categories AND managers

---

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

- [x] Manager roles work with ALL business types
- [x] Integration preserves existing label generation
- [x] Integration preserves business-specific keywords
- [x] EnhancedDynamicClassifierGenerator handles both
- [x] System message combines business + manager info
- [x] Department scope filters both categories and managers
- [x] Forwarding works for all business types

## üß™ Testing Across Business Types

### Test Matrix:

| Business Type | Test Manager | Expected Routing | Status |
|---------------|-------------|------------------|--------|
| HVAC | Sales Manager | SALES emails | ‚úÖ Pass |
| HVAC | Service Manager | SUPPORT/URGENT | ‚úÖ Pass |
| Plumber | Sales Manager | SALES emails | ‚úÖ Pass |
| Plumber | Service Manager | SUPPORT/URGENT | ‚úÖ Pass |
| Electrician | Sales Manager | SALES emails | ‚úÖ Pass |
| Electrician | Service Manager | SUPPORT/URGENT | ‚úÖ Pass |
| Landscaping | Sales Manager | SALES emails | ‚úÖ Pass |
| Flooring | Operations Manager | SUPPLIERS | ‚úÖ Pass |

**Result:** Manager role routing works consistently across ALL business types.
