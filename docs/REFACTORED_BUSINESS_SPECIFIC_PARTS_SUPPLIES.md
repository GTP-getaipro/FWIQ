# âœ… REFACTORED: Business-Specific Parts/Supplies Categories

## ðŸŽ¯ **PartsAndChemicals â†’ Business-Specific Categories**

You were absolutely right! "PartsAndChemicals" was too generic and didn't make sense for all business types. I've refactored it to be **business-specific**.

---

## ðŸ“Š **New SUPPORT Structure**

### **Base Categories (All Businesses Get These 3):**
1. `TechnicalSupport` - Troubleshooting and repair requests
2. `AppointmentScheduling` - Booking/rescheduling/canceling visits
3. `General` - Other support inquiries

### **Business-Specific Parts/Supplies Categories:**

| Business Type | Parts/Supplies Category | Description |
|---------------|------------------------|-------------|
| **Hot Tub & Spa** | `PartsAndChemicals` | Orders or inquiries about spa parts, chemicals, and supplies |
| **Pools** | `PartsAndChemicals` | Orders or inquiries about pool parts, chemicals, and supplies |
