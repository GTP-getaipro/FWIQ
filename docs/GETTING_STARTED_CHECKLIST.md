## ‚ú® Pro Tips

### Development Workflow
1. **Always start with tests** - Write test first (TDD)
2. **Use watch mode** - `npm run test:watch` during development
3. **Check console logs** - Voice analysis logs everything
4. **Use fixtures** - Reuse mock data from `tests/__fixtures__/`
5. **Keep backend running** - Some features need backend API

### Debugging Tips
1. **Check console** - All systems log comprehensively
2. **Use browser DevTools** - Network tab for API calls
3. **Run E2E headed** - See what's happening: `npm run test:e2e:headed`
4. **Check database** - Use Supabase dashboard
5. **Review logs** - Backend logs show API errors

### Best Practices
1. **Follow AAA pattern** - Arrange-Act-Assert in tests
2. **One test, one thing** - Keep tests focused
3. **Mock external APIs** - Never call real APIs in tests
4. **Clean up after tests** - Use `afterEach` for cleanup
5. **Document complex logic** - Future you will thank you

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### Port Already in Use
```bash
# Kill process and restart
netstat -ano | findstr :5173
taskkill /PID <PID> /F
npm run dev
```

### Tests Failing
```bash
# Clear cache and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules coverage
npm install
npm run test:all
```

### Voice Analysis Not Triggering
- Check backend is running on port 3001
- Verify email integration exists
- Check browser console for errors
- Review logs in Team Setup

### Folders Not Creating
- Verify OAuth token is valid
- Check integration status in database
- Review 409 conflict logs (normal)
- Ensure backend API is accessible
