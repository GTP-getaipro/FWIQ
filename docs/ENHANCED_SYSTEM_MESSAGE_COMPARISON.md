Use this information to identify emails intended for specific managers by name 
or by their role responsibilities.

**Hailey** (hailey@thehottubman.ca)
Roles:
  - Sales Manager: Handles quotes, new leads, pricing inquiries
    Keywords: price, quote, buy, purchase, how much, cost, pricing, estimate, 
              proposal, new customer, lead, interested in, want to buy
  - Owner/CEO: Handles strategic, legal, high-priority
    Keywords: strategic, legal, partnership, media, press, executive, important, 
              confidential, high priority, compliance, regulation

Roles:
  - Service Manager: Handles repairs, appointments, emergencies
    Keywords: repair, fix, broken, appointment, emergency, service call, urgent, 
              not working, need help, schedule, maintenance, inspection

**Stacie** (stacie@thehottubman.ca)
Roles:
  - Support Lead: Handles general questions, parts, how-to
    Keywords: help, question, parts, chemicals, how to, support, assistance, 
              information, inquiry, general question, product info

**Classification Guidance for Manager Routing:**
- When an email mentions a manager by name, consider routing to that manager
- When an email contains keywords matching a manager's role, consider categorizing accordingly
- Sales keywords + Hailey = SALES category (not MANAGER)
- Service keywords + Jillian = SUPPORT/URGENT category
```
