## 🚀 Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Use Helper Functions

```javascript
import { buildRoutingNodeCode, generateTeamConfigForN8n } from '@/constants/managerForwarding.js';

// Get managers from database
const managers = profile.managers || [];
const suppliers = profile.suppliers || [];

// Generate routing code for n8n node
const routingCode = buildRoutingNodeCode(managers, suppliers);
```

### Step 2: Add Nodes to Workflow Template

During deployment, inject the 4 new nodes:
1. Route to Manager
2. Build Forward Email Body
3. Should Forward to Manager?
4. Forward to Manager

### Step 3: Update Connections

Connect the nodes in the workflow:
- `Generate Label Mappings` → `Route to Manager`
- `Route to Manager` → `Apply Gmail Labels`
- `Save AI Draft for Learning` → `Build Forward Email Body`
- `Build Forward Email Body` → `Should Forward to Manager?`
- `Should Forward to Manager?` → `Forward to Manager`

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### Manager Configuration

```javascript
{
  name: 'John Doe',
  email: 'john@company.com',
  roles: ['sales_manager', 'owner'],
  forward_enabled: true  // Enable/disable forwarding
}
```

### Department-Aware Forwarding

**Hub Mode** (`['all']`):
- All managers configured in "Route to Manager" node
- Any manager can receive any email based on routing

**Sales Department** (`['sales']`):
- Only sales managers configured in node
- Non-sales emails routed to OUT_OF_SCOPE

**Support Department** (`['support']`):
- Only service managers configured
- Non-support emails routed to OUT_OF_SCOPE
