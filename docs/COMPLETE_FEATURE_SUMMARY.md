# Complete Feature Summary: Manager Role-Based Classification with Department Filtering

## ✅ Implementation Complete

### What You Requested
> "In onboarding process and redeployment, user is able to enter information for the manager. Name, email, role. After that we have to get that information and inject into AI master classifier system message with keywords and description associated with the role for the manager. Classification expected to be made by name and by role."

> "The system message expected to be different for the hub setup deployment and for the team like Sales."

### What Was Delivered

✅ **Manager information capture** during onboarding with name, email, and multiple roles
✅ **Role-specific keywords and descriptions** injected into AI classifier system message
✅ **Classification by manager name** - AI recognizes when managers are mentioned
✅ **Classification by role keywords** - AI routes based on role-specific keywords
✅ **Department-aware filtering** - Different system messages for Hub vs Department modes
✅ **Automatic filtering** - Managers filtered based on their roles matching department scope

## 🎯 Real-World Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Sales Team Email Workflow

**Scenario:** Sales team wants dedicated workflow for quotes and new leads

**Configuration:**
- Department: Sales `["sales"]`
- Managers: John (Sales Manager)
- Keywords Active: price, quote, buy, purchase, how much, cost

**Example Email:**
```
From: customer@example.com
Subject: Quote request for John

Hi John,
Can you send me pricing for your services?
Thanks!
```

**AI Classification:**
- ✅ Recognizes "John" (Sales Manager)
- ✅ Matches keywords: "quote", "pricing"
- ✅ Category: SALES
- ✅ Confidence: 0.95 (name + keywords)
- ✅ ai_can_reply: true

---

### Use Case 2: Support Team Email Workflow

**Scenario:** Support team handles service requests and emergencies

**Configuration:**
- Department: Support `["support"]`
- Managers: Jane (Service Manager), Mike (Support Lead)
- Keywords Active: repair, fix, broken, emergency, help, question, parts

**Example Email:**
```
From: customer@example.com
Subject: URGENT - Equipment not working

Our equipment stopped working and we need
emergency repair as soon as possible!
```

**AI Classification:**
- ✅ Matches keywords: "urgent", "emergency", "repair", "not working"
- ✅ Recognizes Service Manager keywords (Jane's responsibilities)
- ✅ Category: URGENT
- ✅ Confidence: 0.92
- ✅ ai_can_reply: true

---

### Use Case 3: Hub (Central Email Processing)

**Scenario:** Central email hub processes all email types

**Configuration:**
- Department: Hub `["all"]`
- Managers: All managers with all roles
- Keywords Active: All role keywords

**Example Email 1 (Sales):**
```
Subject: Need a quote
```
→ Routed to SALES (John handles)

**Example Email 2 (Support):**
```
Subject: Broken equipment
```
→ Routed to SUPPORT (Jane handles)

**Example Email 3 (Operations):**
```
Subject: Supplier invoice
```
→ Routed to MANAGER or SUPPLIERS (Mike handles)

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### 1. Shared Constants (`src/constants/managerRoles.js`)

```javascript
export const AVAILABLE_ROLES = [
  {
    id: 'sales_manager',
    label: 'Sales Manager',
    description: 'Handles quotes, new leads, pricing inquiries',
    routes: ['SALES'],
    keywords: ['price', 'quote', 'buy', 'purchase', ...]
  },
  // ... 4 more roles
];

export const buildManagerInfoForAI = (managers, departmentScope = ['all']) => {
  // Filters managers by department scope
  // Returns formatted section for AI system message
};
```

### 2. Classifier Generator (`src/lib/enhancedDynamicClassifierGenerator.js`)

```javascript
class EnhancedDynamicClassifierGenerator {
  constructor(businessType, businessInfo, managers, suppliers, actualLabels, departmentScope) {
    this.departmentScope = departmentScope; // Stores department filter
  }
  
  generateManagerInfo() {
    return buildManagerInfoForAI(this.managers, this.departmentScope);
  }
}
```

### 3. Production Classifier (`src/lib/aiSchemaInjector.js`)

```javascript
export const buildProductionClassifier = (
  aiConfig, labelConfig, businessInfo, 
  managers, suppliers, actualLabels, 
  departmentScope = ['all'] // NEW parameter
) => {
  const classifierGenerator = new EnhancedDynamicClassifierGenerator(
    primaryBusinessType, businessInfo,
    managers, suppliers, actualLabels,
    departmentScope // Passed to generator
  );
  
  return classifierGenerator.generateClassifierSystemMessage();
};
```
