# âœ… CORRECTED: Business-Specific Support Categories

## ðŸŽ¯ **Final Structure - SUPPORT Categories Are Business-Specific**

You were absolutely right! The SUPPORT subcategories should be **business-specific**, not generic. Here's the corrected structure:

---

## ðŸ“Š **SUPPORT Category Structure**

### **Base Categories (All Businesses Get These 4):**
1. `TechnicalSupport` - Troubleshooting and repair requests
2. `PartsAndChemicals` - Orders or inquiries about parts and chemicals  
3. `AppointmentScheduling` - Booking/rescheduling/canceling visits
4. `General` - Other support inquiries

### **Business-Specific Categories (Added Per Business Type):**

| Business Type | Additional Support Categories |
|---------------|------------------------------|
| **Hot Tub & Spa** | `WaterCare`, `Winterization` |
| **Electrician** | `CodeCompliance`, `PanelUpgrades` |
| **HVAC** | `IndoorAirQuality`, `DuctCleaning` |

## ðŸŽ¯ **What This Means**

âœ… **Folders Created:** Each business gets 4 base + 2 business-specific = 6 support folders
âœ… **Classifier Trained:** AI knows to categorize emails into business-relevant support types
âœ… **Perfect Alignment:** Folders and classifier use identical structure
âœ… **Business Relevance:** Support categories match what each business actually needs

## ðŸš€ **Implementation Status**

| Component | Status | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **EnhancedDynamicClassifierGenerator** | âœ… Updated | Restored `getBusinessSpecificSupportCategories()` |
| **Folder Provisioning** | âœ… Ready | Will create business-specific support folders |
| **AI Schema Injection** | âœ… Ready | Will inject business-specific categories |
| **Documentation** | âœ… Updated | Reflects correct business-specific structure |

## ðŸŽ‰ **Result**

The system now correctly provides **business-specific support categories** that:

- âœ… Create relevant folders in Gmail/Outlook  
- âœ… Train the AI to categorize emails appropriately
