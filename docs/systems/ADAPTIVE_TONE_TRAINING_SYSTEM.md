## üîß Technical Implementation

### **1. Email History Collection**

**Search Strategy:**
```javascript
const searchQueries = [
  "in:sent newer_than:180d (quote OR estimate OR pricing)",
  "in:sent newer_than:180d (confirm OR scheduled OR appointment)",
  "in:sent newer_than:180d (sorry OR apologize OR apologize)",
  "in:sent newer_than:180d (follow-up OR followup OR check-in)",
  "in:sent newer_than:180d (help OR support OR issue)",
  "in:sent newer_than:180d (thanks OR thank OR appreciate)"
];
```

**Filtering Logic:**
- **Exclude Internal Emails** - Filter out company domain communications
- **Intent-Based Sampling** - Group emails by sales, support, confirmation, etc.
- **Quality Filtering** - Prioritize longer, more substantial emails
- **Representative Selection** - Up to 5 emails per intent category

**Data Extraction:**
```javascript
interface EmailHistory {
  id: string;
  subject: string;
  body: string;
  sender: string;
  recipient: string;
  date: string;
  threadId: string;
  labels: string[];
  intent: string;
  wordCount: number;
  responseTime: number; // minutes from original email
}
```

### **2. AI Style Profiler**

**Advanced Prompt Engineering:**
```
Analyze the following business emails to extract the company's communication style and voice profile.

Focus on:
- Greeting patterns (Hi [Name], Hello, Dear, etc.)
- Closing patterns (Thanks, Best regards, etc.)
- Average email length (short/medium/long)
- Formality level (casual/friendly-professional/formal)
- Common vocabulary and phrases
- Empathy level (0-1 scale)
- Directness level (0-1 scale)
- Apology style
- Confirmation behavior
- Signature consistency

Return a JSON object with this exact structure:
{
  "tone": "string",
  "averageLength": "string",
  "commonPhrases": ["string"],
  "signOff": "string",
  "responseStructure": "string",
  "formalityLevel": 0.0-1.0,
  "empathyLevel": 0.0-1.0,
  "directnessLevel": 0.0-1.0,
  "signatureConsistency": true|false,
  "vocabulary": ["string"],
  "sentencePatterns": ["string"],
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0
}
```

**Voice Profile Structure:**
```json
{
  "tone": "friendly-professional",
  "averageLength": "medium",
  "commonPhrases": [
    "We'll see you then!",
    "Thanks for reaching out",

    "We'll get this sorted out",
    "Appreciate your patience"
  ],
  "signOff": "Thanks,\nThe [Team Name] Team",
  "responseStructure": "acknowledge ‚Üí resolve ‚Üí close",
  "formalityLevel": 0.7,

    "We'll [action] [timeline],",
    "If you have any questions, just give us a call!"
  ],
  "confidence": 0.92
}
```

### **3. Voice Profile Injection**

**AI System Prompt Generation:**
```
You are an AI assistant for {{businessName}}. Your responses must match the company's authentic communication style.

COMPANY VOICE & TONE PROFILE:
- Tone: friendly-professional
- Average Length: medium
- Formality Level: 0.7/1.0
- Empathy Level: 0.9/1.0
- Directness Level: 0.8/1.0
- Signature Consistency: true

COMMON PHRASES TO USE:
- "We'll see you then!"
- "Thanks for reaching out"
- "We'd love to help you"
- "We'll get this sorted out"
- "Appreciate your patience"

RESPONSE STRUCTURE:
acknowledge ‚Üí resolve ‚Üí close

SIGN-OFF PATTERN:
Thanks,
The [Team Name] Team

VOCABULARY:
- pool opening
- water chemistry
- team
- technician
- service
- swimming
- equipment

SENTENCE PATTERNS:
- Hi [Name],
- Thanks for [action],
- We'll [action] [timeline],
- If you have any questions, just give us a call!

INDUSTRY BEHAVIOR PROFILE:
{
  "industry": "Pools & Spas",
  "rules": {
    "allowPricingInReplies": true,
    "includeSignature": true,
    "requireNextStep": true
  },
  "phrasing": {
    "sales": "enthusiastic + helpful + clear next steps",
    "support": "understanding + solution + follow-up"
  }
}

Write responses that sound authentically like {{businessName}}. Use their common phrases, maintain their signature style, and follow their response structure. Be helpful, professional, and match their tone exactly.
```

### **4. Voice Refinement Loop**

**Draft Comparison Analysis:**
```javascript
interface DraftComparison {
  aiDraft: string;
  humanEdit: string;
  emailContext: {
    subject: string;
    recipient: string;
    intent: string;
    category: string;
  };
  timestamp: string;
  businessId: string;
}
```

**Learning Pattern Detection:**
- **Tone Changes** - Detect added enthusiasm, apologies, urgency
- **Phrase Changes** - Identify new phrases added by humans
- **Structure Changes** - Analyze greeting, closing, paragraph changes
- **Empathy Adjustments** - Track empathy level changes
- **Directness Adjustments** - Monitor directness level changes
