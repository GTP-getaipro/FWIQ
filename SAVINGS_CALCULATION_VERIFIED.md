# ✅ Savings Calculation Verification

## Actual Defaults (line 200-205):
```javascript
classificationTime: 3 minutes
responseTime: 8 minutes
hourlyRate: $25/hour
aiAccuracy: 85%
```

## With Your Current Data:
**Processing Rate:** 25.0 emails/day

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Emails Per Year:**
   ```
   25 emails/day × 22 working days/month × 12 months
   = 6,600 emails/year
   ```

2. **Time Per Email:**
   ```
   Classification: 3 min
   + Response: 8 min
   = 11 minutes total
   ```

3. **Time Without AI (Manual):**
   ```
   6,600 emails × 11 minutes
   = 72,600 minutes
   = 1,210 hours/year
   ```

4. **Time With AI (AI handles 85%, human reviews 15%):**
   ```
   6,600 emails × 11 minutes × 15%
   = 10,890 minutes
   = 181.5 hours/year
   ```

5. **Time Saved:**
   ```
   1,210 - 181.5 = 1,028.5 hours
   ≈ 1,029 hours ✅ MATCHES!
   ```

6. **Annual Savings:**
   ```
   1,028.5 hours × $25/hour
   = $25,712.50
   ≈ $25,713 ✅ MATCHES!
   ```

## ✅ Calculations are ACCURATE!

The numbers are correct based on:
- **11 minutes per email** (3 min classify + 8 min draft)
- **85% AI accuracy** (AI handles most work, human reviews 15%)
- **22 working days/month** (standard business month)
- **$25/hour** labor cost

Would you like to adjust any of these assumptions to reflect your actual workflow?
